		<ion-card-content>
		<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>
		After performing this activity, you should be able to identify the forces acting on an object at rest.
		<br><b>Materials:</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		pen<br> pair of scissors<br>
		string book

		<br><br>
		<b>Procedure</b>
		<br>
		Situation 1<br>
		1. Hang a pen by a piece of string as shown in Figure 3a.<br>
		Q1. Is the pen at rest or in motion?

		<br>
		Q2. Are there forces acting on the pen? If yes, draw the forces. You may use arrows to represent these forces.
		<br>2. Cut the string with a pair of scissors.
		<br>Q3. What happens to the pen? What could have caused the penâ€™s motion?<br>

		<b>Situation 2</b><br>
		1. Place a book on top of a table as shown in Figure 3b.<br>
		Q4. Is the book at rest or in motion?<br>
		Q5. Are there forces acting on the book? If yes, draw the forces acting on the book.<br>
		2. Let one member of your group push the book in one direction and another member push it in the opposite direction at the same time with the same amount of push (force).<br>
		Q6. Did the book move? How will you make the book move?<br><br>

		In the situations above, both the pen and the book are at rest. But this does not mean that there are no forces acting on them. So what causes them to stay in place? Consider the next activity.
