			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>
			1. describe common properties of matter;<br>
			2. distinguish properties of matter from those of non-matter; and<br>
			3. demonstrate the skill of measuring mass.<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			1 teaspoon sugar in a plastic cup or small beaker<br>
			½ cup tapwater<br>
			1 piece, stone or small rock<br>
			1 piece, ball (basketball, volleyball, or small beach ball)<br>
			3 pieces of leaves (from any plant or tree)<br>
			5 small wide-mouthed bottles or cups or 150-mL or 200-mL beakers<br>
			1 platform balance or weighing scale<br>
			1 small air pump<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Among the materials displayed in front of you, which do you think is classified as matter? Put a check () under the appropriate column in Table 1. You may make a table similar to the one below. With your group mates, discuss the reason to explain your answer for each sample. Write your answer in the last column.<br><br>

			2. If your group cannot agree on a common answer, you may put a check mark under “not sure” and write all the reasons given by the members of your group.<br><br>
			Q1. What similarities do you observe among the firstfive given samples? Write these common characteristics.<br><br>
			Q2. Does each sample have a measurable mass? Prove your answer by demonstrating how you measure the mass of each sample. Record the mass you got for each sample.<br><br>
			Q3. Do you think that each sample occupies space? Write the reason(s) for your answer.<br><br>
			Q4. How about smoke? Does it have mass? Does it occupy space? Explain your answer.<br><br>
			Q5. Do you think that heat and light have mass? Do they occupy space? Explain your answer.<br><br><br><br>
