		<ion-card-header>What is matter made of?</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>

			1. infer from given situations or observable events what matter is made of; and<br><br>
			2. explain how these observed situations or events give evidence that matter is made up of tiny particles.<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			Â½ cup refined sugar<br>
			1 cup distilled or clean tap water<br>
			1 piece, 100-mL graduated cylinder<br>
			1 measuring cup (1 cup capacity)<br>
			1 piece transparent bottle (can hold one cup of water) or 250-mL beaker<br>
			food coloring (blue, green, or red)<br>
			1 dropper<br>
			1 stirrer (plastic coffee stirrer or stirring rod)<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>
			1. Using a clean and dry graduated cylinder, pour sugar until the 20 mL mark of the graduated cylinder.<br><br>
			2. Transfer the measured sugar into a 250-mL beaker or transparent bottle.<br><br>
			3. Measure 50 mL of distilled or clean tap water using graduated cylinder.<br><br>
			4. Add the 50 mL water to the sugar and mix thoroughly until all the sugar dissolves. Taste the resulting solution. (CAUTION: Do not taste anything in the laboratory unless specifically told to do so by your teacher)<br><br>


			Q1. What is the taste of the resulting mixture?<br><br>

			Q2. Think about sugar and water as made up of tiny particles. With your groupmates, discuss and give your reason(s) for the observations you made in Q1. You may draw illustrations to further explain your reason(s).<br><br>

			5. Transfer the sugar mixture into a graduated cylinder.<br><br>

			Q3. What is the volume of the sugar and water mixture?<br><br>
			
			Q4. Is the volume of the resulting sugar mixture equal, more than or less than the sum (20 mL sugar + 50 mL water) of the volumes of the unmixed sugar and water?<br><br>
			Q5. Think about sugar and water as made up of tiny particles. With your groupmates, discuss and give your reason(s) for the observations you made in Q3. You may draw illustrations to further explain your reason(s).<br><br>
			6. Pour one cup of tap water into a transparent glass bottle.<br><br>
			7. Add one small drop of food coloring slowly along the side of the transparent bottle.<br><br>
			Q6. Describe what you observe after adding the food coloring.<br><br>

			8. Set aside the bottle with food coloring in a locker or corner of your room without disturbing the setup. Describe the appearance of the contents of the bottle after one day. Compare it with the appearance when you left the bottle the previous day.<br><br>
			Q7. What happens to the food coloring dropped in the bottle containing water? Write all your observations in your notebook.<br><br>
			Q8. Think about food coloring and water as made up of particles. With your groupmates, discuss and give your reason(s) for the observations you made in Q6. You may draw illustrations to further explain your reason(s).<br><br><br><br>
