		<ion-card-header>Are the particles of matter moving? What is between them?</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>
			1. infer from observations that particles of matter move; and<br>
			2. represent through a drawing/illustration what is between particles of matter.<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			2 cups tap water<br>
			1 piece, 30 mL plastic syringe (without the needle)<br>
			1 piece, wide-mouthed transparent bottle (200 or 250 mL capacity)<br>
			1 piece, narrow-mouthed transparent bottle (100 mL capacity)<br>
			1 plastic or glass dinner plate<br>
			½ cup rock salt (not iodized salt) or ½ cup sand<br>
			food coloring (blue, green, or red)<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Pull the plunger of the syringe until it reaches the 30 mL mark of the syringe.<br><br>
			2. Press your thumb on the tip of the plunger and use your other thumb to push the plunger once.<br><br>
			Q1. Can you push the plunger all the way through the syringe while your thumb presses on the tip of the plunger? Why or why not?<br><br>
			Q2. What do you feel as you push the plunger?<br><br>
			3. This time, push the plunger of the syringe all the way to the end of the syringe. Suck water from the cup or container up to the 30-mL level of the syringe. Cover tightly the tip of the syringe with your thumb.<br><br>
			Q3. What do you feel as you push the plunger?<br><br>
			Q4. Compare what you felt when you pushed the plunger with the air and with the water?<br><br>


			Q5. Explain what you observe. You may represent your comparison by drawing an illustration of the syringe and the particles of air and another illustration of the syringe and the particles of water.<br><br>
			4. Pour ½ cup of tap water into one transparent glass bottles.<br><br>
			5. Pour the ½ cup of tap water in step #4 into another bottle or beaker. Observe carefully the flow of water.<br><br>
			Q6. Did water take the shape of the container?<br><br>
			6. This time, pour the water just on the flat surface of a dinner plate.<br><br>
			Q7. What do you observe? Write all your observations.<br><br>
			7. Examine a single piece of bottle cap. Put it inside the bottle. Observe carefully what happens as you transfer it by tilting the bottle into the dinner plate.<br><br>
			Q8. What do you observe? Write all your observations.<br><br>
			8. Pour ½ cup of rock salt or sand into the narrow-mouthed bottle. Observe carefully what happens to rock salt as you pour it into the bottle and when all of it has been transferred.<br><br>
			Q9. Did rock salt or sand take the shape of the bottle? Did the particles of rock salt change in shape?<br><br><br><br>
