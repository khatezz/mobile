		<ion-card-header>What changes take place when water is left in an open container? In a closed container?</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>

			1. describe what happens to water when it is left in an open container for some time;<br><br>
			2. represent through drawings/illustrations what happens to the particles of water when it is left in an open container;<br><br>
			3. describe what happens to water when it is left in a closed container for some time; and<br><br>
			4. explain the processes taking place at the sub-microscopic level.<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			1 cup tap water<br>
			3 pieces, watch glass or 2 pieces, shallow transparent plastic container with covers (used for condiments)
			<br>
			1 piece, 1 teaspoon or ½ measuring tablespoon<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Pour 1 teaspoon or ½ tablespoon of tap water into the watch glass. This is container No.1. You can write “No. 1” on a piece of paper and place it under the watch glass. Cover container No.1 and set it aside.<br><br>

			2. Pour 1 teaspoon or ½ tablespoon of tap water into the second watch glass. This is container No. 2. Do not cover container No. 2.<br><br>

			3. Put container No. 2 beside container No. 1 in an area of your laboratory or room where these can be kept overnight.<br><br>

			4. During your next science class, discuss with your groupmates the following questions and write your answers in your notebook.<br><br>
			Q1. Describe what happened to the water in container No. 1.<br><br>
			Q2. Describe what happened to the water in container No. 2. Compare the volume of water left in container Nos. 1 and 2.<br><br>
			Q3. Where do you think did the water go? Describe this process by writing your description or drawing an illustration. Label the parts of your drawing. You can use “call outs” in your drawing.<br><br>
			Q4. Would anything happen differently if you heated container No. 2? Explain your answer.<br><br>
