			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>
			1. describe what happens to water when it is heated;<br><br>
			2. describe what happens to water when it is cooled;<br><br>
			3. represent through drawings/illustrations what happens to the particles of water when it is heated and then cooled; and<br><br>
			4. explain the processes taking place at the sub-microscopic level.<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			100 mL tap water (or ½ cup tap water)<br>
			1 piece, beaker or Erlenmeyer flask, 200 or 250 mL<br>
			1 piece, small watch glass<br>
			1 piece, tripod<br>
			1 piece, wire gauze (without the asbestos)<br>
			1 piece, alcohol lamp<br>
			safety matches<br>
			1 marker pen (any color)<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			Part A. Boiling Water<br><br>


			1. Pour ½ cup or 100 mL of water into the beaker and mark the level of water outside the beaker.<br><br>
			2. Put the beaker with water on top of the tripod as shown in Figure 5.<br><br>
			3. Let the water boil using the alcohol lamp. Observe carefully what is happening to the water when it is already boiling.<br><br>
			Q1. Describe what you observe in the water inside the beaker and above the level of water.<br><br>
			4. You may do any of the following: write a description or draw a cartoon or illustration to demonstrate how the particles of water behave as they are heated.<br><br>


			Add to your skit or cartoon or illustration your answers to Q2 to Q5.<br><br>
			Q2. What do you think is inside the bubbles that form when the water boils? Where did they come from?<br><br>
			Q3. If you keep the water boiling for more than 10 minutes, what do you think will happen to the amount of water in the beaker? Why?<br><br>
			Q4. Where did the water go?<br><br>
			Q5. Can you explain by illustration how the water changes from liquid to gas? What is happening to the particles of water?<br><br>
			5. After boiling the water for 10 minutes, remove the alcohol lamp and put off the flame.<br><br><br>

			Part B. Cooling Water<br><br>
			1. Using the hot water that has boiled from Part A, cover the beaker with watch glass.<br><br>
			Q6. Describe what you observe in the water inside the beaker and at the bottom of the watch glass.<br><br>
			You may do any of the following: write a description or draw a cartoon or illustration to demonstrate how the particles of water behave as they are heated.<br><br>
			Add to your skit or cartoon or illustration your answers to Q6 to Q9.<br><br>
			Q7. Where does the water at the bottom of the watch glass come from?<br><br>
			Q8. Can you explain by illustration how the water changes from gas to liquid?<br><br>
			Q9. Describe what is happening to the particles of water.<br><br>
