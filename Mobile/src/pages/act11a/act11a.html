			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>

			1. compare the masses of the subatomic particles using different ways of visual representation<br><br>
			2. infer which subatomic particle contributes to the mass of the atom<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			pencil/pen<br>
			crayons or colored pencils<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Refer to the masses of the subatomic particles in Table 2. Arrange the subatomic particles in increasing mass.<br><br>
			Q1. Which subatomic particle is the lightest?<br><br>
			Q2. Which subatomic particle is the heaviest?<br><br>
			Q3. Which subatomic particles have almost the same mass?<br><br>

			2. Show a comparison of the masses of the three subatomic particles using a bar graph. Refer to Figure 2 in the next page, assuming that the first bar represents the mass of the proton; draw the bars to represent the masses of the neutron and the electron. Take note that the masses are expressed in the -28 exponent.<br><br>

			3. This time, using a pie chart, show the proportion of the masses of the subatomic particles for an atom composed of only 1 proton, 1 neutron and 1 electron.<br><br>

			4. A seesaw can show a comparison between two masses of an
			object. A seesaw goes up and down depending on the
			mass it carries on each side.<br><br>

			Q4. How does the mass of the neutron compare with the mass of the proton? Using circles to represent the particles show the comparison by drawing a seesaw with the particles on it.<br><br>

			Q5. How many electrons should be placed on one side of the seesaw to balance it if the other side has 1 proton on it, like the one shown below? Write the number on the space provided in the illustration below.<br><br>

			5. Take a look again at the different visual representations you have made.<br><br>
			Q6. Which subatomic particle/s make/s up most of the mass of the atom?<br><br><br><br>
