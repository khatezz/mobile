			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>
			1. simulate and describe Thomson’s model of the atom<br>
			2. simulate and describe Rutherford’s model of the atom<br>
			3. deduce that scientific models may change over time<br><br>

			<b>Part A<br>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			Box containing a marble and a regularly shaped object fixed in place<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Get the activity box from your teacher. Write the box number on your worksheet. Inside the box are the “mystery object” which is fixed in place and one marble. Without opening the box, guess the shape, size and location of the mystery object.<br><br>
			Q1. What is the shape of your “mystery object”?<br><br>
			Q2. What is the size of the “mystery object”? Draw a picture of the “mystery object” showing its size relative to the box.<br><br>
			Q3. Where is it located in the box? Draw a picture of the “mystery object” showing its location within the box.<br><br>
			Q4. How were you able to infer the shape, size and location of the “mystery object” in the box?<br><br>
			2. Open the box and check how close you are in guessing the size, shape and location of the “mystery object”.<br><br>
			Q5. How close was your guess? If given the chance to guess another “mystery object”, will you change your strategy? If yes, what changes will these be?<br><br>
			3. With the permission from your teacher, you may again try to guess another “mystery object”.<br><br>


			How was your experience in Part A? Perhaps, you had felt the same excitement as what our scientists felt when they are trying to determine what was inside the atom, its structure. The excitement comes from guessing about something that is unseen, much like guessing what is inside a box that you received as gift on your birthday! The scientists had to look for ways to find out what the eyes cannot see, similar with what you did in Part A.<br><br>

			When the idea of the atom was first proposed by the ancient Greeks, they thought it was a particle with no parts. However, towards the 19th century, J.J. Thomson was able to discover that atoms have negatively-charged particles, which he called electrons. It led him to propose a new model for the atom, which he called the plum pudding model. Thomson proposed that the negatively-charged electrons were embedded in a kind of cloud or soup of positive charge, as shown in the figure on the right. Since plums and puddings are not commonly known in the Philippines, it may work better for you that we use the other name for the model, the raisin bread model.<br><br>

			In science, models, based on observations from experiments are tested further, sometimes by other scientists, to determine their validity. A group of scientists composed of Ernest Rutherford, Johannes "Hans" Wilhelm Geiger and Ernest Marsden tested Thomson’s model by bombarding a very thin sheet of gold foil with positively-charged alpha particles. Their experiment is referred to as the alpha particle scattering experiment. In the next parts of the activity, you will simulate parts of the experiment that the group of Rutherford did.<br><br>

			<b>Part B<br>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			one piece of 25 centavo coin<br>
			paper, any small piece will do<br>
			smooth, clean table, counter or floor<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Tear 20, very small pieces of paper, the size of mongo beans.<br><br>
			2. Scatter the pieces in a circle on the floor, about one foot in diameter. Imagine these to be the electrons in the Thomson’s raisin bread model of the atom.<br><br>
			3. As forcefully as you can, slide the coin to hit the circle of paper pieces. Imagine the coin to be the high speed alpha particle in Rutherford’s experiment.<br><br>
			Q1. What do you observe? What happened to the coin?<br><br>
			4. If you repeat what you did with the coin and the paper pieces many times, do you think you will make the same observation as you did above about what happens to the coin?<br><br>


			Using a setup similar to the figure below, Rutherford and his coworkers expected all of the alpha particles to travel undeflected through the atoms of gold like the coin in the above activity. They observed that most of the alpha particles did go through the gold foil undeflected. But what surprised them was that there were a few alpha (α) particles that practically bounced back towards the source and some that were deflected at smaller angles. Rutherford was reported to have exclaimed, “It was as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a sheet of tissue paper and it came back to hit you.”<br><br>

			<img src="img/168.png"><br><br>

			Recall what happened in Part A. How did you manage to know some information about the mystery object? Perhaps, you guessed by the way the marble is “bumping” the mystery object. You may even had a guess on where the mystery object is possibly located within the box. Perhaps, this guess also came from the “non-bumping” of the marble to anything except the sides of the box. Similarly, the way the alpha particles “bumped”, or did not “bump”, the particles in the atoms of the gold foil led Rutherford’s team to propose another model for the atom, the nuclear model. In the raisin bread model, where the electrons with very small mass were scattered in a cloud of positive charge, there was no region within the atom where there would be an appreciable net concentration of charge that would cause the alpha particles to be deflected. To account for the few deflections and the rare occasions of very large deflections, Rutherford, in 1911, suggested a different structure of the atom where all the positive charge and nearly all the mass of the atom were concentrated in a very tiny region called the nucleus at the center of the atom. The rest of the atom, where the tiny electrons with very small mass moved, was largely empty space through which the alpha particles could travel undeflected.<br><br>
			
			This model replaced the one proposed by Thomson and is the model that we hold to this time, with respect to the placement of the nucleus in the atom. In Part C, you will simulate the alpha particle scattering by the gold foil in Rutherford’s experiment using his model of the atom.<br><br>

			<b>Part C<br>Material Needed:</b><br><br>

			pencil<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Refer to Figure 3 in the next page. Using this schematic representation of the atoms of the gold foil, draw the path of the positively-charged alpha particles as they move through the atoms.<br><br>

			Q1. What happens to a positively-charged alpha particle that comes near the positively-charged nucleus?<br><br>

			Q2. What happens when the positively-charged alpha particle directly hits the positively-charged nucleus?<br><br>
			2. The representation of the gold foil that has been given to you is not quite to scale. The nucleus is very tiny compared to the size of the atom. The ratio of the size of the nucleus to that of the atom is 1:100,000. If the nucleus were about 1 mm in diameter, the atom would have a diameter of 100 meters, which is about the height of 30-story building.<br><br>
			Q3. Imagining this relative size of the nucleus compared to the atom, would there be many more or fewer alpha particles that would pass through the gold foil undeflected compared to the number in your schematic representation?<br><br>
			Q4. What do you think are the chances of the alpha particle directly hitting the nucleus?<br><br>


			<img src="img/169.png"><br><br>

			The nuclear model of the atom proposed by Rutherford in 1912 is still the picture of the atom that we hold today. Observations made afterward in experiments concerning the atom support the model.<br><br>

			The other puzzle about the atom concerns the electrons. Imagine again the atom as 100 meters in diameter, the nucleus, around one millimetre in diameter at the center and the electrons are in this vast space around the nucleus. Where in this vast space are the electrons? Are they moving? How do they move? How fast do they move?<br><br>

			One of the models of the electrons in atoms is the planetary model where the electrons were thought to move in orbits around the nucleus similar to the way planets like the earth move around the sun. This has since been found to be incorrect. The behaviour of electrons in the space around the nucleus is not simple to describe. What we do know, however, are the following: (1) The electron although it is negatively charged does not collapse into the positively charged nucleus; (2) There is attraction between the nucleus and the electron, evidence of which is that energy is required to remove an electron from the atom.<br><br>

			Notwithstanding the complex behaviour of electrons in atoms, we continue to use a model of electronic structure (or the way electrons are “arranged” in the atom) to help us understand and study the way atoms combine to form the millions of compounds discovered to date.
			<br><br>

			So far, you have learned about the three subatomic particles — protons, electrons and neutrons — and how they are arranged in the currently accepted model of the atom. Among these subatomic particles, it is the number of protons that identify the atoms of an element. All atoms of an element contain the same number of protons in their nuclei. This number is the element’s atomic number. In the next activity, you will refer to the periodic table in determining the atomic number. Notice that no two elements have the same atomic number.<br><br><br><br>
