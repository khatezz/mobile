			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>
			1. locate the atomic number in a periodic table,<br>
			2. identify the subatomic particles associated with mass number,<br>
			3. determine the number of neutrons from the mass number,<br>
			4. define an isotope,<br>
			5. interpret shorthand notations for isotopes and atoms,<br>
			6. infer that ions are formed from the removal or addition of electron/s,<br>
			7. evaluate the overall electrical charge of an atom, and<br>
			8. make an inventory of subatomic particles of a given element.<br><br>

			Periodic Table<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Refer to the periodic table at the end of this module. Locate the atomic number.<br><br>
			Q1. What is the element with an atomic number of 15?<br><br>
			Q2. How many protons does the atom of this element have?<br><br>
			Q3. How many protons are there in an atom of aluminum?<br><br>
			Q4. Which element has the smallest number of protons in its atom?<br><br>
			2. While the number of protons is the same with atoms of a particular element, the number of neutrons may vary. Atoms having the same number of protons but different number of neutrons are referred as isotopes. The isotopes are identified through their mass number which is the sum of the number of protons and the number of neutrons in an atom. A shorthand notation for isotope includes the element’s symbol and mass number, for instance, Ca-40.<br><br>
			Consider two isotopes of carbon, C-12 and C-13.<br><br>
			Q5. How many protons are there in the C-12 isotope? How about the number of neutrons?<br><br>
			Q6. How many protons are there in the C-13 isotope? How about the number of neutrons?<br><br>
			3. Atomic mass is the mass of an atom of a particular element. It is the average of the mass numbers of the naturally occurring isotopes of the element multiplied with their respective abundance. You will not compute for atomic mass. However, you have to know, at least, where to find it in the periodic table.<br><br>
			Refer to the periodic table at the end of this module.<br><br>
			Q7. What is the atomic mass of magnesium (Mg)? How about for potassium (K)?<br><br>

			4. The figure on the right shows another shorthand notation.<br>
			Information on the subatomic particles may be derived
			from this shorthand. The base is the element’s symbol.
			The left subscript denotes the atomic number, therefore
			the number of protons may be known. The superscript at
			the left denotes the mass number wherein the number of
			neutrons may be derived. On the other hand, the superscript at the right denotes the charge wherein the number of electrons may be determined. When there is no superscript at the right, it means that the charge is zero (0).
			Atoms may gain charges, as you have experienced in Activity 1. This happens when electrons are lost or gained by the atom. When this happens, the atom become an ion.<br>
			Consider the lithium ion shown in the notation above.<br>
			Q8. How many protons are there in the lithium ion?<br>
			Q9. How many neutrons are there in this lithium ion?<br>
			Q10. How many electrons are there in the lithium ion?<br><br>

			5. Complete the table below.<br><br>

			6. Using any reference, write the shorthand notation showing mass number and atomic number for all the naturally occurring isotopes of iron.<br><br><br><br>
