			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>
			1. trace the development of the periodic table; and<br>
			2. describe how the elements are arranged in the periodic table.<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			paper<br>
			whole manila paper<br>
			pencils or pens<br>
			ruler<br>
			masking or adhesive tapes<br>
			element cards provided by the teacher (3 cm x 5 cm)<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:<br
			>Part A</b><br><br>

			1. Element cards are posted on the board. The elementâ€™s properties and the compounds it can form are listed in each card. As a class, go over each card. Notice that the cards are arranged in increasing atomic mass. While keeping the order of increasing atomic mass, put the elements with similar properties in the same column.<br><br>

			Q1. How many groups of elements were formed?<br><br>
			Q2. What criteria did you use to choose which group an element belongs to?<br><br>
			Q3. Are there any exception/s to these trends? If so, which elements break the trend? Why did your group arrange these elements the way you did?<br><br>

			Q4. Are there any gaps in your arrangement? Where are they? What do you think these gaps might mean?<br><br>

			The development of the Periodic table could be traced back in 1817 to the work of Johann Dobereiner, a German chemist who formed the triads of elements with similar properties like the triad of calcium, barium and strontium. In 1863, John Newlands, an English chemist proposed the Law of Octaves. He based his classification of elements on the fact that similar properties could be noted for every eight element when they are arranged in order of increasing atomic masses. Around 1869 two scientists determined a way to put the elements in order. Lothar Meyer and Dmitri Mendeleev both came up with periodic tables that showed how elements should be grouped. It is interesting to note that these two scientists did not personally know each other, yet they came up with the same conclusions. Both scientists were teachers living and working in different places. Meyer lived and worked in Germany while Mendeleev in Russia. Both arranged the elements in order of increasing atomic mass while putting in groups those with similar properties. Both of them also left blank spaces in their tables, believing that these spaces would be filled later with elements yet to be discovered.<br><br>


			<b>Part B</b><br><br>

			1. Using the table of elements you have created in Part A, place in that table the additional element cards that your teacher will give you.<br><br>

			Q5. How did your table of elements change each time you added new elements?<br><br>
			Q6. How is the table of elements you prepared similar to the modern periodic table? How is it different?<br><br>
			Q7. How do you explain the fact that tellurium comes before iodine in the modern periodic table, though it has a higher atomic mass than iodine?<br><br>
			Q8. Mendeleev predicted the existence of gallium and germanium because of the gaps in his table. Why do you think Mendeleev did not predict the existence of the noble gases?<br><br>
			Q9. Refer to the modern periodic table. Suppose 2 new elements were discovered with the atomic numbers 120 and 121. Where in the Periodic table do you think you would place these new elements?<br><br>
			Q10. Suppose a new element X is known. It forms a compound with chlorine, and the formula of this compound is XCl4. What group or family do you think this element would belong?<br><br>
