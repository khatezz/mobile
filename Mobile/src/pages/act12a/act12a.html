		<ion-card-header>Metal… Metal: How reactive are you?</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>
			1. compare the relative reactivity of metals in acid solution<br>
			2. find ways of preventing corrosion due to the reactivity of metals<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			a piece of copper wire - 4 cm. long<br>
			a strip of aluminum – 4 x 1 cm. (Don’t use the glossy aluminum)<br>
			a strip of zinc metal – 4 x 1 cm.<br>
			an iron nail – 1 inch long<br>
			40 mL (10 – 12 % HCl) commercially sold muriatic acid<br>
			4 clean glass bottles of the same size (gerber or sandwich spread bottles will do)<br>
			10 mL glass graduated cylinder<br>
			sand paper or steel wool<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Get 4 clean glass bottles
			and using 10 mL
			graduated cylinder,
			pour 10 mL of
			muriatic acid into
			each bottle.<br><br>
			2. Prepare the iron nail,<br><br>
			copper wire, strips of
			aluminum and zinc metals. Clean these metal samples by rubbing them with sand paper or steel wool.
			3. Place the iron nail in one glass bottle containing muriatic acid (HCl) and observe.<br><br>
			4. Place a white sheet of paper behind the bottle. This will make it easier to observe any reaction to happen.<br><br>
			5. Observe for 3 minutes. Record all observed changes in the table below.<br><br>

			6. Repeat procedure numbers 3 to 5 using each of the remaining metals. Compare the results.<br><br>
			Q1. Which of these metals – Fe, Cu, Al and Zn – reacts with muriatic acid?
			Which did not react with muriatic acid?<br><br>
			7. Arrange the metals in the order of their decreasing reactivity.<br><br>
			8. A reaction does not always happen between a metal and a compound. In this case, the reaction of metals with acid, like HCl, produces bubbles of hydrogen and a colorless solution of the metal chloride. There is an existing definite order of reactivity existing among metals and hydrogen according to their ability to displace one another. This arrangement is called the metal reactivity series or activity series of metals. The activity series is an arrangement of metals according to decreasing order of reactivity, as shown below.<br><br>

			Q2. What is the position (with respect to hydrogen) in the activity series of the metals that reacted or unreacted with muriatic acid (HCl) in the activity?<br><br>

			9. Locate the positions in the periodic table of the following elements from the activity series (these are members of the representative block): potassium (K), sodium (Na), lithium (Li), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and aluminum (Al).<br><br>

			Q3. Potassium, sodium, lithium are metals belonging to Group 1. In this group, how does reactivity vary – increasing or decreasing from top to bottom in the periodic table?<br><br>
			Q4. Does the relative reactivity of calcium and magnesium follow this trend?<br><br>
			Q5. Sodium, magnesium and aluminum belong to Period 2. Does reactivity increase or decrease from left to right among elements in a period.<br><br>
			10. From your answer in Q3-Q5, make a generalization of the variation of the reactivity of metals for those belonging to a group and for those belonging to a period.<br><br>
			11. Refer to the table, Activity Series of Metals.<br><br>

			Q6. Which will be more reactive in the following pairs of metal in every case?<br><br>
			a. Mg or Na with HCl<br>
			b. Ag or Al with HCl<br>
			c. Fe or Zn with CuSO4<br>
			12. Think about the changes that you have observed around you, particularly those involving metals. You may also try to recall what you have done in Grade 7 when you placed an iron nail in a container of acetic acid.<br><br>
			Q7. What harmful change/s is/are brought about when a metal reacts or mixes with acids?<br><br>
			Q8. What are some ways of preventing corrosion of metals?<br><br>
