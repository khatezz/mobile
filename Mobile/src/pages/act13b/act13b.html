		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>
			1. explain how enzymes affect digestion; and<br>
			2. infer chemical changes in food as it undergoes chemical digestion.<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			1 tablespoonful of granulated gelatin<br>
			10 mL fresh pineapple juice<br>
			10 mL bromeliad leaf juice<br>
			water<br>
			measuring cup<br>
			spoon<br>
			100 mL graduated cylinder<br>
			10 mL graduated cylinder<br>
			3 droppers<br>
			3 test tubes<br>
			test tube rack<br>
			markers<br>
			hot plate<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Number and label the test tubes (1-water, 2-fresh pineapple juice, and 3-bromeliad leaf juice).<br><br>
			2. Prepare one tablespoonful of granulated gelatin in the measuring cup using 100 mL of boiling water.<br><br>
			3. Stir well with a spoon until the gelatin is dissolved.<br><br>
			4. Place 3 mL of water into test tube 1, 3 mL of fresh pineapple juice into test tube 2, and 3 mL of bromeliad leaf juice into test tube 3.<br><br>
			5. Add 10 mL of gelatin mixture to each test tube. Shake well to mix thoroughly.<br><br>
			6. Refrigerate the samples overnight.<br><br>
			7. On Day 2, check the contents of each test tube for solidification of the contents. Record your observations.<br><br>

			Food undergoes physical and chemical change as it moves from one part of the gastrointestinal tract to the other. Digestion makes the nutrients found in food available to the different parts of the body for the organismâ€™s nourishment and overall wellness. In Activity 2, an enzyme called bromelain which is present in fresh pineapple juice and in bromeliad plants is used to demonstrate digestion of proteins.<br><br>

			Q7. How did bromelain affect the protein in gelatin?<br>
			Q8. Which of your observations show this effect?<br>
			Q9. There are other kinds of enzymes in your digestive system. How do these enzymes affect digestion?<br><br>

			Bromelain refers to a group of enzymes from bromeliad plants that break down proteins. They are proteases. Bromelain is found in both fresh pineapple and bromeliad leaf juices. This should not come as a surprise because pineapple is a bromeliad plant.<br><br><br><br>
