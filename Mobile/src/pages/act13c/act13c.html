			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>
			1. describe the process of chemical digestion; and<br>
			2. explain how enzymes act as catalyst during digestion.<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			1 tablespoonful of granulated gelatin<br>
			10 mL fresh pineapple juice<br>
			water<br>
			measuring cup<br>
			spoon<br>
			100 mL graduated cylinder<br>
			10 mL graduated cylinder<br>
			3 droppers<br>
			3 test tubes<br>
			test tube rack<br>
			markers<br>
			hot plate<br>
			1 M HCl<br>
			1 M NaOH<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Label the test tubes (A – acid, B – base, C – control water)<br><br>
			2. Prepare one tablespoonful of granulated gelatin in the measuring cup using 100 mL of boiling water.<br><br>
			3. Stir well with a spoon until the gelatin is dissolved.<br><br>
			4. Place 3 mL of pineapple juice into each of the labeled test tubes. Transfer 1 mL each of HCl, NaOH, and water into the corresponding test tubes of pineapple juice.<br><br>


			5. Transfer 10 mL of gelatin mixture to each test tube.<br><br>
			6. Using a spoon, stir the gelatin well until it dissolves completely.<br><br>
			7. Refrigerate the test tubes overnight.<br><br>
			8. On day 2, observe the contents of each test tube. Record your observations.<br><br>

			What is chemical digestion? Where does chemical digestion take place in the human digestive tract?<br><br>
			Q10. What role do the digestive enzymes have in digestion?<br><br>
			Q11. In which test tube did you observe the greatest amount of protein digestion?<br><br>
			Q12. In which test tube did you observe the least amount of protein digestion?<br><br>
			Q13. How do you explain your results?<br><br>
			Q14. Did your results support your hypothesis? Explain your answer.<br><br>
			Q15. In the human digestive tract, where is protein digested chemically?<br><br>
