		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After you have performed this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>
			1. identify the different stages of mitosis in plant and animal cells, and<br>
			2. differentiate plant and animal mitoses.<br><br>

			<b>Materials:</b><br><br>

			Prepared slides of onion root tip and white fish blastula<br>
			Compound microscope<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Examine the onion root tip and white fish blastula slides under the microscope. Based on the descriptions provided in the previous section, identify and draw from each slide the following: interphase, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Cells do not divide at the same time. Therefore, you will find cells at different stages of mitosis. With the LPO, locate and study the cells at these stages, then switch to the HPO to study the chromosomes in detail.<br><br>

			2. Locate the centrioles at opposite sides of a mitotic cell. These form star-like structures called asters at the poles of the spindles.<br><br>

			Q1. Where can you find these centrioles, in plant cells or animal cells?<br><br>

			3. Detect the presence of cleavage furrows in the mitotic cell of the white fish blastula. Cleavage furrows grow inward in the cell membrane until the cell is divided into two.<br><br>

			Q2. Do you also find a cleavage furrow in mitotic plant cells?<br><br><br><br>
