		<ion-card-header>Tossing coins and probability</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objective:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to predict the outcomes of crosses based on the principle of probability.<br><br>

			<b>Materials:</b><br><br>

			2 coins, a piece of paper, and a pencil or pen<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>
			1. On a piece of paper, make a chart similar to the one given below.<br><br>

			<img src="img/210.png"><br><br>

			2. Toss a coin. If a head comes up, mark column 1; if a tail, then mark column 2. Make 50 tosses of the coin.<br><br>
			3. Get the total number of times each face of the coin appears. Calculate the percentage of the appearance of each face. To compute the percentage:<br><br>

			(total / 50) x 100 %<br><br>

			Q1. What is the ratio of heads to tails?<br><br>
			4. Let us assume that the coin represents the genotype of a parent, and each face is an allele, with the head as the dominant allele (H) and the tail as the recessive allele (h).<br><br>
			Q2. What is the ratio of the gametes of this parent with heterozygous genotype?<br><br>
			5. On the same piece of paper, make a chart similar to the one given below.<br><br>

			<img src="img/211.png"><br><br>

			6. Toss the two coins together. If a head-head combination appears, mark column 1; if head-tail, mark column 2; and if tail-tail, mark column 3. Make 50 tosses of the coins.<br><br>
			7. Get the total number of times each combination appears. Calculate the percentage of the appearance of each combination. To compute the percentage:<br><br>
			(total / 50) x 100 %<br><br>
			Q3. What is the ratio of a head-head, head-tail, and tail-tail combination when you make 50 tosses?<br><br>
			Q4. If you toss the same coins in 100,000 times, would you approximately get the same ratio?<br><br>
			Q5. Let the head (H) represent a dominant gene and the tail (h), a recessive gene. Compare the ratio you obtained in this activity with the one obtained by Mendel in his monohybrid F2 generation peas (see Table 3). Are they approximately similar?<br><br>
