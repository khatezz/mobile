		<ion-card-header>Comparing genotypic and phenotypic ratios for a typical Mendelian trait</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objective:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to solve for the phenotypic and genotypic ratios of any given cross.<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			Let D = dominant allele and d = recessive allele, while DD, Dd, and dd represent the homozygous dominant, heterozygous dominant, and homozygous recessive genotypes, respectively. For each type of cross, determine the genotypic and phenotypic ratios, respectively. The first cross was already done for you.<br><br>

			This table summarizes the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of typical Mendelian traits. Knowing the Mendelian genotypic and phenotypic ratios can make solving genetic problems easier.<br><br>
