		<ion-card-header>Phenotypes and genotypes in incomplete dominance</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objective:</b><br><br>

			This activity will reinforce the genotypic and phenotypic ratios in a typical incompletely dominant trait.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			In four oâ€™clock plants, R1 is the allele for red color and R2 is for white color. Two pink flowered plants were crossed.<br><br>
			Q1. How many types of gametes will each parent produce?<br><br>
			Q2. What are the phenotypes of the offspring?<br><br>
			Another cross was made involving a red flowered plant and a pink flowered plant.<br><br>
			Q3. What would be the phentopytic and genotypic ratios of the offspring of this cross?<br><br><br><br>
