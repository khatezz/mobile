			<b>Chordates</b><br><br>

			Animals belonging to Phylum Chordata have four characteristics that are present in any of the stages in their life cycle. These are the notochord, the dorsal hollow nerve cord, gill slits and a post-anal tail. In many chordates, the notochord later becomes the backbone. Humans being a member of the chordate group have the notochord, tail and gill slits only in the embryo stage.<br><br>

			However, there are lower chordates that do not have a backbone. Examples are the tunicates and lancelets. The adult tunicates have only the gill slits present but the larva stages have all the four features. Tunicates attach to solid materials like rocks or coral reefs. They are filter feeders, taking in food particles suspended in water.<br><br>

			Lancelets have the four chordate characteristics present in the adult stage. They live in the sandy ocean bottom. They are also suspension feeders. Lancelets move in a fishlike motion using the muscles on both sides of their body.<br><br>

			<b>Vertebrates</b><br><br>

			Most vertebrates are sea and land dwellers forming the large group of chordates. The vertebrates’ notochord is replaced by the backbone or the vertebral column (vertebra, plu. vertebrae). The nerve cord is enclosed by the projections of the vertebrae. The protected nerve cord enlarges at the anterior end to develop into the brain. The tail can be the bone and muscle that animals use for swimming in aquatic species. For some vertebrates, the gill slits remain till the adult stage. In others, these are modified into structures for gas exchange.<br><br>

			<b>Fishes</b><br><br>

			Fishes are vertebrates found in salty, fresh, cold or even hot water. Most have scales for protection, paired fins for movement and gills for gas exchange. Fishes may lay eggs to reproduce or give birth to live young. They are cold bloodied because their body temperature changes when environment temperature changes. Certain fishes do not have true teeth or may be jawless as compared to the others.<br><br>

			Jawless fishes belong to Class Agnatha. Examples are the lampreys and hag fish. Lampreys, being parasites, have tooth-like structures in their mouth that can attach to bodies of other fishes and feed on their tissues and blood. The hagfish is wormlike and use a toothlike tongue to eat dead organisms.<br><br>

			Cartilaginous fishes include the rays, skates and sharks. They have a skeleton made of the soft, flexible protein material called cartilage. Most cartilaginous fishes are covered with a tough, sandpaperlike skin due to the presence of toothlike scales. Skates and rays have winglike fins and move in a gliding motion through the water. Some of them eat floating planktons while others feed on invertebrates at the bottom of seas and oceans.<br><br>

			Sharks may feed on small fishes or on floating algae. The whale shark (Rincodon typus), the largest fish, and locally known as butanding is found in marine waters of Cebu, Sorsogon and Dumaguete.<br><br>

			The diverse groups of bony fishes belong to Class Osteichthyes. These are the fishes that have an endoskeleton made of hard, calcium material called bone. Bony fishes are more familiar to you like bangus (milkfish), tuna, goldfish, and tilapia. The non-familiar lungfish breathes through the lungs in addition to having gills also for respiration. Eels are wormlike fishes. Figure 23 shows some of the members of the bony fishes.<br><br>

			Q59. Compare the skeleton of the shark and the tilapia.<br><br>
			As food of humans and other animals, you will learn more about the role of fishes in food chains and food webs which you will study in the next module.<br><br>

			<b>Amphibians</b><br><br>

			Amphibia means “double life” from which amphibians got their name. This refers to animals that live part in water and part on land. Most lay small, shell-less eggs surrounded by jellylike substance in moist places or in water. These hatch into tadpoles with gills and tails. They lose the tail to develop lungs as well as legs and move to land but close to water or damp habitats. They also have moist skin to help the lungs for gas exchange while in dry land. Amphibians are divided into three groups, the caecilians, salamanders, and frog and toads. Ceacilians live in water or bury themselves in moist soil. Salamanders live in forest floors under rocks and decaying logs.<br><br>

			Both frogs and toads jump. Some frogs can leap and attach to tree trunks and branches. Toads are terrestrial and can even survive in hot places or desert. Frogs have smooth skin while toads have rough or warty skin. Frogs and toads eat worms, insects or small animals.<br><br>

			<img src="img/250.png"><br><br>

			Q60. Refer to Figure 24. Which amphibian(s) is/are tail-less?<br><br>
			Q61. Which of them do not have legs?<br><br>

			<b>Reptiles</b><br><br>

			Reptiles are animals that exhibit more adaptations for living on land. They lay eggs with shells to protect them from drying. They also have smooth or rough scales for protection from loss of body water.<br><br>

			Lizards and snakes have smooth scales. Examples of lizards are the house lizard, gecko (tuko), monitor lizard (bayawak), chamleleon and horned toad. Snakes are legless and have flexible jaws to enable them to swallow their prey whole. A common snake species is the reticulated python seen in zoos. Poisonous species include the cobra and the rattle snake. Snakes however, avoid people and do not attack unless provoked or hurt.<br><br>

			Crocodiles and alligators are also reptiles. They are predators of fish, deers, small cows or carabaos, and even attack humans. Alligators live in freshwater and are only found in North and South America. Crocodiles live in fresh and salty waters in tropical and subtropical regions. In the Philippines, two species are present, the endemic Crocodylus mindorensis (Philippine Crocodile) and the saltwater Crocodylus porosus. The Philippine crocodile is considered a critically endangered crocodile species in the world.<br><br>

			Bodies of turtles and tortoises are enclosed in a shell. The head, legs and tail are pulled inside this shell as protection from predators. Tortoises live on land while turtles live mostly in water. Pawikan (marine turtles) live in the sea and females come to shore only to lay eggs. There are species of marine turtles which are at present in danger of extinction.<br><br>

			<b>Birds</b><br><br>

			If reptiles are adapted to land life, most birds are adapted to fly. Characteristics of birds that enable them to fly include: presence of wings and feathers, large flight muscles in the breast bone and reduced weight. Birds weigh less because their bones are light and hollow filled with air. Birds also have eggs with shells and the legs are covered with scales. Their body temperature remains the same despite varying environmental temperature due to the insulation provided by feathers.<br><br>

			Birds have bills or beaks (Figure 25), and in coordination with the type of wings and feet they have, are adapted to where they live and the kind of food they eat.<br><br>

			<img src="img/251.png"><br><br>

			Q62. Examine the beak of the Philippine eagle. If it is for cutting, what do you think does this bird eat?<br><br>

			Examples of birds that do not fly are the kiwi, penguin and ostrich.<br><br>

			Q63. Compare the legs of amphibians and reptiles with birds that you are familiar with.<br><br>

			You often eat chicken during meals or even merienda. Or maybe balut and salted eggs from ducks are your favourites! Snakes and big animals also prey on smaller birds. You enjoy the relaxing chirping or singing of some birds and their varied colors. Although certain birds feed on rice or corn grains, they have a role in dispersing seeds to various places, resulting to perpetuation of many plant species.<br><br>

			The Philippine Eagle, which is found only in our country, has been declared as a critically endangered species. It means that there is a possibility that the species will disappear or be lost. The main reason is the loss of their habitat-- the forests -- due to logging and their conversion to farmlands.<br><br>

			Q64. If you live somewhere in eastern Luzon, Samar, Leyte or Mindanao where the Philippine eagles specifically live, suggest ways to protect their habitat.<br><br>

			<b>Mammals</b><br><br>

			Mammals differ from other animals because they have mammary glands that produce milk to nourish their young and most have hair or fur. They breathe in air, have four-chambered hearts and are warm-bloodied. Most of them also give birth to live young and care for them.<br><br>

			The first group of mammals, called monotremes, lay eggs similar to those of birds. The spiny anteater (echidnas) living in Australia, New Zealand and New Guinea as well as the duck-billed platypus are monotremes (Figure 26).<br><br>

			<img src="img/252.png"><br><br>

			Marsupials or the pouched mammals also give birth to live young. After birth, the young are kept inside pouches and are nourished with the milk from the mammary glands within these pouches. Some marsupials are found in Central and South America. The opossum lives only in North America. Others, such as the more familiar koalas, kangaroos and wombats and flying phalangers, are found in Australia and New Zealand.<br><br>

			The eutherians comprise the largest group of mammals. Known as the placental mammals, they bear fully developed young inside the mother’s uterus. These young are attached to the placenta through which they receive nourishment until they are born. After birth, they continue to be cared for and nourished by milk from the mammary glands. Table 2 presents the different groups of placental mammals and their representatives.<br><br>

			<img src="img/253.png"><br><br>

			Q65. Which of the eutherians live in water?<br><br>

			Q66. In your observation, how do humans differ from other primates?<br><br>

			Primates are the most highly developed of all animals. They are able to walk erect, with fingers and toes adapted to grasp or hang on branches and hold things or manipulate food. They also have a high degree of intelligence. Primates exhibit social behavior like living in organized groups or communities. They take care of orphaned individuals or even fight with competing groups. Scientists would like to believe that the care given by females to their young contribute to their ability to survive.<br><br>

			Q67. What characteristics differentiate mammals from other animals?<br><br>

			Mammals are present in various places, from the very cold to the warmest regions and in salt waters. Many live among humans. Mammals have become an important part of ecosystems. In grasslands, zebras eat plants and in turn are killed and eaten by lions. In forests, bats eat insects and compete with monkeys for fruits. Seeds are then spread for plants to grow in other areas. Wastes of these mammals serve as fertilizers to plants. In human communities, rats carry bacteria and dogs virus that cause diseases. In farmlands, carabaos work for people, while cows, sheep and goats provide meat and milk. Rats destroy crops and compete with humans for rice grains. In whatever way, good or bad, mammals affect the ecosystems where they live.<br><br>

			You have just gone through all the different groups of organisms on Earth known to science at present. You have learned about their similarities and differences. The discussions and activities also showed how they are useful to one another and the whole ecosystem or how some harm others.<br><br>

			<b>Low and High Biodiversity</b><br><br>

			In the earlier grades you learned that among different ecosystems, the rainforest has the highest biodiversity. This means that it has the greatest number of species living in it. Rainforests have a high rainfall, thus, have lots of plants in them. This condition provides shelter, water and food to many species that can survive drought or disasters as well as competition with other species. This results to a stable ecosystem with lesser rate of species loss. Tropical rainforests are located in places near the equator, while temperate rainforests are found in the temperate regions.<br><br>

			Q68. Based on the discussion above, how will you describe an ecosystem with low biodiversity?<br><br><br><br>
