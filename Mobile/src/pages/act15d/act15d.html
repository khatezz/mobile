			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>

			1. Make a personal and group vision for the future in relation to biodiversity<br><br>

			2. Analyze the different ways that government, groups, and individuals are doing in order to arrive at the envisioned future, and<br><br>
			
			3. Take personal action towards conserving biodiversity.<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			copies of “Priority Pyramid” worksheet and “Making it Happen” handout for each student and for each small group<br>
			pencil or ballpen<br>
			notebook or sheet of paper for the “future log”<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			Part I. My Future World<br><br>

			1. As a class, you are going to make a list of conditions that you want to see in your world in the future and then, suggest ways and take action to make it happen. Ask yourself this question: What do you want the future world to be? What things or conditions do you want to see in the world, say, 50 years from now? Make a list of at least five such conditions.
			<br><br>
			2. Be ready to share your ideas when your teacher will ask the class. Your classmates will be sharing their ideas as well, so listen carefully. Your teacher will write all the ideas on the board. Look at what visions of the future you and your classmates have come up with.<br><br>

			Q80. What conditions do you and your classmates want to see in your future world?<br><br>

			3. Get a copy of the “Priority Pyramid” from your teacher. Complete this pyramid with the conditions that you want your future world to have, ranking them from the most important to the least. Write what for you is the most important condition at the topmost box of the pyramid, the next two conditions on the next level, and so on.<br><br>

			4. You will next share your personal pyramid in a small group. When it is your turn, show your group your pyramid and explain how you chose your top three conditions. When it is the turn of your groupmates to share, be sure to listen to their explanations as well.<br><br>

			5. Now, discuss with your groupmates and create a group pyramid that will represent your group’s priorities for the future. Each one should make a copy of your group pyramid. Decide who among you will present to the class your group’s top three priorities.<br><br>

			6. Compare your personal pyramid to the pyramid that your group came up with.<br><br>

			Q81. Why are there similarities and differences?<br><br>
			Q82. How do you feel about the final result, that is, the group pyramid?<br><br>
			Q83. How do you feel about the process you went through to come up with the group pyramid?<br><br>
			Part II. Making it Happen<br><br>
			Q84. Will our dreams for the future come true by simply thinking about them?<br><br>
			1. Look at the different blocks (conditions) on your group pyramid. Are you aware of anything that you or other people are already doing to ensure that these will happen in the future? Make a list and discuss these with your groupmates.<br><br>

			Q85. Do you know of any ongoing programs, initiatives and legislations related to these priorities?<br><br>
			Q86. What government agencies, organizations, groups and individuals are responsible for or are working on the conservation of biodiversity, either locally or on a global scale?<br><br>


			2. Obtain a copy of the “Making it Happen” handout from your teacher. Read about each of the projects and choose those that you think are making or will make significant contributions to meeting the top three priorities in your group pyramid. For each project that your group will choose, write a sentence or two to describe ways it is working to achieve the identified priority. You can also add what your group thinks as the project’s strongest and weakest points.<br><br>

			Part III. I Can Make a Difference!<br><br>

			Q87. What can you do to create a positive future?<br><br>
			
			1. Keep a “future log” for a week. Your log should list in bullet form, all your activities, behaviors, speech and thoughts for each day. At the end of each day, think about and write down how each bullet item affects the world around you, either positively or negatively, and what consequences it could have for the future.<br><br>
			2. Each day, add ways that you can do more to help preserve the earth’s biodiversity.<br><br>
			Q88. What changes in your daily actions can you carry out to contribute to conserving biodiversity?<br><br><br><br>
