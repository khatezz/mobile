		<ion-card-header>How do you identify the components of a food chain in an ecosystem?</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>

			1. distinguish between producers and consumers.<br>
			2. analyze the transfer of energy from one organism to another.<br>
			3. construct a food chain in a given ecosystem.<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b>
			<br><br>
			an article about “Monfort Bat Cave”<br>
			Activity sheet<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Read an article about “Monfort Bat Cave.”<br>
			2. Read the following questions, and write your answer on the space provided.<br><br>

			Q2. What are the organisms found in the surrounding area of Monfort Bat Cave? List them down in the table below.<br><br>

			Q3. What group/s of organisms are considered as producers?<br><br>
			Q4. What part of the durian trees and other trees served as food for the bats?<br><br>
			Q5. The population of cave-dwelling bats is declining because they are being eaten by other organisms. What are these organisms that feed on bats?<br><br>
			Q6. Among the organisms that feed on bats, are there organisms that possibly feed on the predators of bats? ___ Yes ___ No<br><br>

			3. Divide the organisms into the following categories as shown in the table below:<br><br>

			4. Based on Table 2, construct a food chain with at least 3 organisms representing the producer, 1st order consumer and 2nd order consumer.<br><br>

			Q7. You have just analyzed the transfer of energy by categorizing the organisms according to their trophic level. In your own words, describe a food chain.<br><br>

			Food chains may be interconnected to form a food web. For example, one kind of food may be eaten by several consumers. Or several foods may be eaten by one consumer. A simplified food web in a Philippine forest is shown in Figure 2.<br><br>

			Figure 3 shows a simplified food web in a marine environment. Microscopic algae serve as the producers which are eaten by zooplankton. Zooplankton, in turn, are eaten by small fish and other marine organisms.<br><br>

			The food web in Figure 4 includes a third group of organisms. Besides the producers and the consumers, the food web shows the decomposers consisting of bacteria and fungi. Decomposers act on dead organisms and change these to simple nutrients which plants can use again.<br><br>

			Q8. Without decomposers, will producers and consumers stay alive? Why?<br><br>
			Q9. Without producers, will consumers stay alive? Why?<br><br><br><br>
