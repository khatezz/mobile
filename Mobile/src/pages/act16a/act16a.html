		<ion-card-header>Making food webs</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			Think of the food your family ate for supper last night. Make a food web based on your meal. Remember, your food web must have producers, consumers, and decomposers.<br><br>

			Q10. To which group of organisms do you belong?<br>
			Q11. Which trophic level do you occupy?<br><br>

			<b>Food Pyramid</b><br><br>

			When organisms eat, they take in matter as well as energy into their bodies. For example, when you eat chicken, the flesh of the chicken containing nutrients and energy enters your body. You use the nutrients and energy to build muscles and other parts of your body and to perform various activities.<br><br>

			The transfer of matter expressed as biomass and energy in food from one trophic level to another are not one hundred percent used. Biomass is the total mass of organisms in a food chain or a food web. Not all plants or animals at one level are eaten by organisms at the next level. Some parts of plants or animals are not edible, for example, wood, peel of some fruits, some seeds, shells, and bones. In addition, much of the energy is lost as heat. Only about 10% of biomass and energy are transferred to the next level. This relationship between producers and consumers can be demonstrated through a biomass pyramid and an energy pyramid (Figure 5). In the case of the marine environment, the source of energy in the food chains is also the Sun.<br><br>

			What do these pyramids demonstrate? A large amount of producers at the base of the pyramid will be needed to support only a few of the consumers at the top. The largest amount of biomass and energy are at the base of the pyramid. A decrease or loss occurs at each succeeding level. As shown in Figure 5, 10 000 kg of plankton that photosynthesize are needed to support only 1 000 kg of plankton that do not photosynthesize. Planktons that photosynthesize are producers used as food by the planktons that do not photosynthesize, the primary consumers. In turn, 1 000 kg of the primary consumers would support only 100 kg of small fish, which in turn would sustain only 10 kg of lapu-lapu. At the highest level are humans. Note that 10 kg of lapu-lapu would sustain only 1 kg of the biomass of humans. Due to the loss of biomass at each level, 10 000 kg of plankton at the base of the pyramid would support only 1 kg of humans who are the top consumers.<br><br>

			In an energy pyramid the base of the pyramid is reduced and only 10% moves to the next level. This loss goes on at every level until only 0.01% reaches the top consumers.<br><br>

			Consider the food web in Figure 5. A food web can also fit into an energy pyramid. It shows the flow of food through different organisms living in an area.<br><br>

			Construct an energy pyramid based on the food web. Include only the producers and the consumers. Exclude the decomposers for a while.<br><br>

			Q12. Which group of organisms has the greatest biomass? Which has the greatest energy?<br><br>
			Q13. Which group of organisms has the least biomass? Which has the least energy?<br><br>
			Q14. What happens to the amount of biomass from the bottom to the top of the pyramid?<br><br>
