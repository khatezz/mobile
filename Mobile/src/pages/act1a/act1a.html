		<b>Balance of forces</b><br>
		Objectives:<br>
		After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>
		1. examine the conditions when two forces balance, and<br>
		2. explain the effect of balanced forces on the state of motion of an object.
		<br><br>	
		

		<b>Materials:</b><br>
		4 sets spring balance<br>
		1 piece of sturdy cardboard<br>
		threads<br>
		Procedure:<br><br>
		1. Bore four holes around the cardboard as shown. Label the holes A, B, C, and D.<br>
		2. Attach threads to the holes.<br>
		3. Attach a spring balance to thread A and another one to thread D. Hold the cardboard to keep it still. Pull the balances along the same line such that when released, the cardboard remains at rest.<br>
		4. When the cardboard is at rest, examine the magnitudes and directions of the two forces by reading the spring balance.<br>
		5. Draw the line of action of the forces acting on the cardboard. Extend the lines until they intersect. Mark the point of intersection and draw arrows starting at this point to represent the forces acting on the cardboard.<br>
		6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 for pair B and C.<br>
		
		Q7. When the cardboard is at rest, how do the magnitudes and directions of the pair of forces acting on it compare?<br>
		7. Now here is a challenge. Find out the directions of all the forces such that when all the threads were pulled with the same amount, the cardboard will not move or rotate when released.<br>
		Q8. If you draw the lines of action of all the forces acting on the board and extend the lines, what will you get?
