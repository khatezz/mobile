		<b>Force and acceleration</b><br><br>
		<b>Objective:</b><br><br>

		After this activity, you should be able to describe how the net force acting on an object affects its acceleration.<br><br>

		<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>
		Consider this situation below:<br><br>

		A group of students conducted an experiment to determine the relationship between the force acting on the object and its acceleration. They used identical rubber bands to pull the cart as shown in Figure 8. They varied the number of rubber bands to vary the force acting on the cart. They started with 1 rubber band, then with 2, 3, and 4 rubber bands, making sure that they stretched the rubber bands to the same length every time they pull the cart. They used a ticker tape timer to determine the acceleration of the cart. A ticker tape was connected to the cart such that when the cart was pulled, the paper tape will be pulled through the timer. And as the paper tape was pulled through the timer, small dots are formed on the tape.<br><br>


		Starting with the tape for 1 rubber band, they marked the first clear dot and every 6th dot thereafter and cut the tape along these points (Figure 9). Then they pasted the strips side by side in order on a graphing paper to produce the tape chart for F=1 unit. They did the same for the other tapes to produce tape charts for F=2 units, F=3 units, and F=4 units.

		A. Tape chart analysis<br><br>

		1. Obtain from your teacher the copies of the tape charts produced by the students for the 4 runs.<br>
		Q12. Compare the charts. What similarities and differences have you noticed among them?<br><br>

		The length of strip in each chart represents the total distance travelled by the cart over a time interval of 0.10 seconds. Recall that the total distance travelled over a unit time gives the average velocity of the moving body, or speed when travelling in straight line. Hence, each strip represents the average velocity of the cart over a time interval of 0.10 seconds.<br><br>


		2. Examine the tape chart for F=1 unit.<br>

		Q13. What does the increase in the lengths of the strips suggest? What can you say about the motion of the cart - is it moving in uniform motion or is it accelerating? Is this also true with the other runs?<br>
		Q14. How do you compare the increase in length of the strips in F= 1 unit? What does this tell you about the change in the velocity of the cart? Is this also true with the other tape charts?<br>
		Q15. How do you compare the increase in length of the strips among the four tape charts? Which tape chart shows the greatest increase in the length of the strips? Which tape chart shows the least increase in the length of the strips?<br>
		3. Draw a line that passes through all the dots at the ends of the strips in F=1 unit. Do the same for the other tape charts.<br>
		Q16. Describe the line formed. Does the same pattern exist for the other tape charts?<br><br>

		B. Quantitative analysis<br><br>
		
		You can also use the tape chart to compute for the average velocity (vave), change in velocity (Δv), and acceleration (a) of the cart for each run. Work only on the tape chart assigned to your group. Other groups will be working on the other charts. You may follow the simple instruction below.<br>
		4. Label each strip 1,2,3,4, and 5 as shown in Figure 10.

		5. Compute for the average velocity of the cart over each time interval by measuring the length of the strip and dividing it by the time covered to travel such distance. Example, if the length of the strip is equal to 2.5 cm, then the average velocity during that time interval will be<br><br>


		vave = 2.5 cm / 0.10sec<br>
		= 25 cm/s<br><br>


		Q17. How do the values of vave compare? What does this tell you about the motion of the cart?<br>
		6. Next, determine the difference in the average velocities (Δv) of the cart between two successive time intervals. Example, you can get the difference in the average velocities between strips 1 and 2, between strips 2 and 3, and so on.<br>
		Q18. How do the computed values of Δv compare? What does this tell you about the motion of the cart?<br>
		7. Recall that acceleration is defined as the change in velocity per unit of time. To get the acceleration of the cart, divide your computed values of Δv in step 6 by 0.10 seconds, the unit of time. Have at least three computed values of acceleration.<br>
		Q19. How do your computed values of acceleration compare?<br>
		8. Compute for the average acceleration aave.<br>
		9. Ask from the other groups the values of aave for the other tape charts. Record them all in Table 1 below.

		Q20. In this activity, the number of rubber bands represents the magnitude or amount of the force acting on the cart. How is acceleration of the cart related to the amount of force acting on it?<br><br>
