			<b>Action-reaction</b><br><br>
			<b>Objective:</b><br><br>

			In this activity, you should be able to compare two interacting forces in terms of magnitude and direction.<br><br>

			<b>Materials:</b><br><br>
			2 spring balances<br>
			string<br><br>
			
			<b>Procedure:</b><br>
			1. Connect 2 spring balances with their hooks. Ask your partner to hold one end of the balance while you hold the other end horizontally. Pull the spring balance while your partner just holds the other end. Record the reading on each balance.<br>
			Q21. What is the reading on your balance and that of your partner? What do these values represent?<br>
			Q22. How do you compare the direction of your partnerâ€™s and your force?<br>
			2. Pull the spring balance harder. Be careful not to exceed the maximum reading on the spring balance.<br>
			Q23. What is the reading on your balance and that of your partner?<br>
			Q24. How do you explain your observation?<br>
			3. Attach one end of your spring balance to the wall, while the other end is connected to the second spring balance. Ask your partner to pull the spring balance. Observe the reading on each balance.<br>
			
			Q25. What is the reading in each balance?<br>
			Q26. Compare the direction of the forces exerted on the two ends of the connected spring balance.<br><br>
			
			In the simplest sense, a force is a push or a pull. However, Newton realized that a force is not a thing in itself but part of mutual action, an interaction, between one thing and another.<br><br>

			For example, consider the interaction between a hammer and a nail. A hammer exerts a force on the nail and drives it into a board. But this is not the only force present for there must also be a force exerted on the hammer to stop it in the process. What exerts this force? The nail does. Newton reasoned that while the hammer exerts a force on the nail, the nail exerts a force on the hammer. So, in the interaction between the hammer and the nail, there is a pair of forces, one acting on the nail and the other acting on the hammer. Such observations led Newton to his third law: the law of interaction.
