		<ion-card-header>Activity 3<br>How POWER-ful am I?</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objective:</b><br><br>

		After performing this activity, you should be able to compute for your power output in walking or running up a flight of stairs.<br><br>

		Materials Needed:<br><br>

		meterstick<br>
		timer<br><br>

		<b>Procedure:</b><br>
		1. Write the group members’ names in the first column of Table 1.<br>
		2. Enter each member’s weight in column 2. To solve for the weight, multiply the mass (in kg) by acceleration due to gravity (g=9.8 m/s2).<br>
		3. Measure the height of the flight of stairs that you will climb. Record it on the table.<br>

		4. Each member will walk or run up the flight of stairs. Use a stopwatch or any watch to get the time it takes for each member to climb the stairs. Record the time in the 4th column.<br>

		5. Solve for the energy expended by each member. Record them in the 5th column of the table.<br>
		6. Compute for the power output of each member.<br><br>

		Table 1

		Q1. Who among the group members had the highest power output?<br>
		Q2. What is the highest power output?<br>
		Q3. Who among the group members had the lowest power output?<br>
		Q4. What is the lowest power output?<br>
		Q5. What can you say about the work done by each member of the group? Did each member perform the same amount of work in climbing the stairs?<br>
		Q6. What factor/s determined the highest/lowest power output?<br><br>
