			<ion-card-header>Activity 1<br> The dancing salt and the moving beads!</ion-card-header>
			<ion-card-content>
				<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

				At the end of the activity, you will be able to infer that:<br><br>

				1. sound consists of vibrations that travel through the air; and<br>
				2. sound is transmitted in air through vibrations of air particles<br><br>

				<b>Materials:</b><br><br>

				1 rubber band<br>
				1 piece of plastic sheet<br>
				1 empty large can of powdered milk - 800 g<br>
				1 wooden ruler<br>
				1 empty small can of evaporated milk - 400 mL<br>
				rock salt<br>
				1 dowel or 1 wooden rod<br>
				1 blue bead<br>
				4 colored beads<br>
				3 inches of tape<br>
				2 large books<br>
				scissors<br>
				5 pieces of string<br>
				paper<br>
				slinky spring<br>
				transistor radio<br><br>

				<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

				Part A: Vibrations produce sound<br><br>

				1. Prepare all the materials needed for the activity. Make sure that you find a work area far enough from other groups.<br>
				2. Put the plastic tightly over the open end of the large can and hold it while your partner puts the rubber band over it.<br>
				3. Sprinkle some rock salt on top of the plastic.<br>
				4. Hold the small can close to the salt and tap the side of the small can with the ruler as shown in Figure 4.<br><br>

				Q1. What happens to the salt?<br>
				5. Try tapping the small can in different spots or holding it in different directions. Find out how you should hold and tap the can to get the salt to move and dance the most.<br>
				Q2. How were you able to make the salt move and dance the most?<br>
				Q3. What was produced when you tapped the small can? Did you observe the salt bounce or dance on top of the plastic while you tapped the small can?<br>
				Q4. What made the salt bounce up and down?<br>
				Q5. From your observations, how would you define sound?<br>
				6. Switch on the transistor radio and position the speaker near the large can. Observe the rock salt.<br>
				7. Increase the volume of the radio while it is still positioned near the large can. Observe the rock salt again.<br>
				Q6. What happened to the rock salt as the loudness is increased?<br>
				Q7. Which wave characteristic is affected by the loudness or the intensity of sound?<br><br>

				Part B: Transmitting sound<br><br>

				8. Let 2 books stand up as shown in Figure 5. Place the dowel on top of the 2 books.<br>

				9. Cut out an image of a human ear from a magazine and tape it to one of the books.<br>
				10. Start with the blue bead. Tape the string to the mark on the dowel that is farthest away from the ear.<br>
				11. Then tape the 4 colored beads to the other 4 marks. Make sure that all the beads hang in a straight line.<br>
				12. The colored beads represent air particles. Create vibrations (sound) in the air by tapping the blue bead toward the colored beads.<br>
				Q8. What happens to the other colored beads when the blue bead is tapped?<br>
				13. Create more vibrations by continuously tapping the blue bead and observe the other beads.<br>
				Q9. Are there occasion when the beads converge then expand?<br>
				14. If the beads represent air particles, what do the converging and expanding of the beads represent?<br>
				15. Connect one end of the slinky to a fixed point. Hold the other end then push and pull the slinky continuously. Record your observations.<br>
				Q10. Are there converging and expanding parts of the slinky?<br>
				Q11. How then is sound classified as a wave?<br>
				16. This time shake the other end of the slinky while the other end is still connected to the fixed point. Record your observations.<br><br><br>
