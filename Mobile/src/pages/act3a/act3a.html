		<ion-card-header>Activity 2<br>Characteristics of waves: Comparing longitudinal and transverse waves</ion-card-header>
			<ion-card-content>
				<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

					At the end of the activity, you will be able to:<br><br>

					1. distinguish the different characteristics of waves;<br>
					2. determine their frequency and wavelength; and<br>
					3. compute the wave speed based on the frequency and wavelength<br><br>

					<b>Materials:</b><br><br>

					Pentel pen or permanent marker<br>
					stopwatch or mobile phone<br>
					meterstick<br>
					old calendar (big poster calendar) or old newspaper<br>
					metal slinky<br><br>

					<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

					1. Place the old calendar or old newspaper on the floor. Make sure that the newspaper or old calendar is long enough to accommodate the full length of the slinky spring.<br><br>

					2. Put the slinky on top of the old newspaper or old calendar. Ask one of your groupmates to hold one end of the slinky at the one end of the newspaper. This will serve as the fixed end.<br><br>

					3. Another groupmate will hold the other end of the slinky. This is the movable end.<br><br>

					4. The other members of the group should be along the sides so they can mark the corresponding crests. Identify a reference point (point A) along the slinky from which you are going to base your frequency count.<br><br>

					5. Shake the movable end. Apply just enough force to create large wave pulses. Make sure, however, that the crest and trough parts will still be formed within the newspaper area.<br><br>

					6. Another groupmate should count the number of pulses passing through point A in a minute. This is the frequency in waves per minute. You can convert this later to waves per second.<br><br>

					7. While your classmate is creating transverse waves by shaking the slinky, note by marking on the newspaper the crest and the trough of the created wave pulses.<br><br>

					8. Trace the wave form then measure the wavelength of the wave pulses. Record all your data on the answer sheet provided.<br><br>

					9. Repeat steps 5 to 8 for two more trials. Compute for the wave speed in each of the 3 trials. Determine also the average speed of the wave in the slinky.<br><br>

					10. For the second set up, repeat the whole procedure (steps 1 to 9) but this time instead of shaking the slinky, pull and push the slinky to create a longitudinal wave.<br><br>

					11. Note and mark the areas/regions in the newspaper where the slinky forms compressions and rarefactions.<br><br>

					12. Count the number of compressions passing through point A in a minute. This is the frequency of the longitudinal wave in waves per minute.<br><br>

					13. Measure the length between 2 compressions. This is the wavelength of the longitudinal wave.<br><br>

					14. Do this for three more trials, and then compute for the wave speed and the average speed of the wave in the slinky.<br><br>

					Q12. When there are more waves passing through the reference point in a period of time, which wave characteristic also increases?<br><br>

					Q13. When there are more waves passing through the reference point in a period of time, what happens to the wavelength of the waves?<br><br><br>
