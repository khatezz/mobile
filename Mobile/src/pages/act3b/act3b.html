		<ion-card-header>Activity 3<br>Sound race...Where does sound travel fastest?</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objective:</b><br><br>

			At the end of the activity, you will be able to distinguish which material transmits sound the best.<br><br>

			<b>Materials:</b><br><br>

			watch/clock that ticks<br>
			mobile phone<br>
			wooden dowel 80-100 cm long<br>
			metal rod 80-100 cm long<br>
			string (1 meter)<br>
			metal spoon<br>
			3 pieces zip lock bag (3x3) or waterproof mobile phone<br>
			carrying case<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Hold a ticking watch/clock as far away from your body as you can. Observe whether or not you can hear the ticking.<br>
			2. Press one end of the wooden dowel against the back part of the watch and the other end beside your ear. Listen very well to the ticking sound. Record your observations.<br>
			3. Repeat step #2 using a metal rod instead of the wooden dowel. Record your observations.<br>
			Q14. Did you hear the watch tick when you held it at arm's length? When you held it against the wooden dowel? When you held it against the metal rod?<br>
			4. Repeat steps #1 to #3 using a vibrating mobile phone instead. Record your observations.<br>
			Q15. Did you hear the mobile phone vibrate when you held it at arm's length? When you held it against the wooden dowel? When you held it against the metal rod?<br>
			5. Place the mobile phone in the waterproof carrying case and dip it in a basin of water while it vibrates.<br><br>

			Q16. Based on your observations, which is a better carrier of sound? Air or wood? Air or water? Air or metal? Water or metal?<br>
			6. At the center of the meter long string, tie the handle of the metal spoon. Hold the string at each end and knock the spoon against the table to make it ring or to create a sound. Listen to the ringing sound for a few seconds then press the ends of the strings against your ears. Observe and record the difference in sound with and without the string pressed against your ear.<br>
			7. Knock the spoon against the table. When you can no longer hear the sound of the ringing spoon, press the ends of the string against your ears. Record whether or not you could hear the ringing of the spoon again.<br>
			Q17. How did the sound of the spoon change when the string was held against your ears?<br>
			Q18. When the ringing of the spoon was too quiet to be heard through the air, could it be heard through the string?<br>
			Q19. Is the string a better carrier of sound than air?<br><br>

			So, through which material does sound travel fastest? Through which material did sound travel the slowest? Why does sound travel fastest in solids and slowest in air? Do you have any idea what makes sound move fast in solids?<br><br>

			Figure 9 shows a model for the three states of matter. Identify which is solid, liquid or gas. Now, do you have any hint why sound moves fastest in a solid medium? To give us a better picture of the differences of the three states of matter, consider worksheet 1. Then with the aid of Activity No.4 entitled Chimes... Chimes... Chimes... you will be able to determine what makes solid the best transmitter of sound.<br><br>

			<b>Worksheet 1: Solids, Liquids, and Gases</b><br><br>

			Direction: Using several resources and references, compare the different characteristics of solids, liquids, and gases by completing the table below.<br><br><br>
