		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objective:</b><br><br>

			At the end of the activity, you will be able to infer using improvised chimes that closely spaced materials are the best transmitters of sound.<br><br>

			<b>Materials:</b><br>
			<br>
			materials for chime<br>
			nylon string or thread<br>
			plastic lid or wood about 1 ½ foot long<br>
			small electric fan<br>
			scissors<br>
			nail and hammer<br>
			beads<br>
			paint<br>
			iron stand<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			Improvised Chime<br><br>

			1. Go on a treasure hunt and look for items that will create a lovely sound when they collide, such as seashells, bells, beads, spoons, forks, and stones.<br>
		 	2. If the items are thin enough, poke a hole through them with a nail. Then pull a piece of string or nylon thread through each hole, and tie a knot. <br>
			3. For heavier objects, such as stones, spoons, or forks; wrap the string around the object a few times, and rub non-toxic liquid glue over the string to hold it in place.<br>
			4. Next, find a colorful plastic lid or a nice looking pieces of wood to serve as the top of the wind chime. <br>
			5. Tie at least 6 of these stringed objects on the plastic lid or on the wood. Make sure that the strands are evenly spaced and are not too far apart from each other. <br>
			6. Finally, tie another string at the two ends of the plastic lid or on the wood for hanging the chime.<br><br>

			Sounding the Chimes<br><br>

			1. Hang your chime in an iron stand where there is no wind source except your handy fan.<br>
			2. With the 6 stringed objects hanging on the wooden or plastic lid, switch on the fan and observe. This is your CHIME 1. Listen to the sound created by your chime. Ask one of your groupmates to move away from the chime until the sound is not heard anymore. Measure this distance from the chime to your groupmate and record your results.<br>
			3. Repeat step #2 but add 4 more stringed objects on the chimes creating chime with 10 stringed objects. Make sure that you tie the additional stringed objects in between the original ones. This is your CHIME 2.<br>
			Q20. With which chime did you record a longer distance?<br>
			Q21. Which chime had more stringed objects? Which chime had more closely spaced stringed objects given the same wooden lid?<br>
			4. Repeat step #2 but add 4 more stringed objects on the chime creating a chime with 14 stringed objects. This is your CHIME 3.<br>
			Q22. With which chime did you record the longest distance?<br><br>

			Q23. Which chime has the most stringed objects? Which chime has the most closely spaced stringed objects given the same wooden lid?<br>
			Q24. How would you relate the measured distance reached by the sound created by the chime and the spacing of the stringed objects in each of the 3 chimes?<br>
			Q25. Which chime is capable of transmitting sound the best?<br>
			Q26. How would you relate the distance of the stringed objects in the chime and the capability of the chime to transmit sound?<br><br>
