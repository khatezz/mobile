		<ion-card-header>Activity 5<br>Faster soundâ€¦ In hotter or cooler?</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b> Objective:</b><br><br>

			At the end of the activity, you will be able to determine how temperature affects the speed of sound.<br><br>

			<b>Materials:</b><br><br>

			3 pieces 1000 mL graduated cylinders or tall containers<br>
			thermometer<br>
			bucket of ice<br>
			electric heater or alcohol lamp<br>
			tuning fork<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Label the 3 graduated cylinders with HOT, ROOM TEMP, COLD respectively.<br>
			2. Half-fill the ROOM TEMP graduated cylinder with tap water.<br>
			3. Sound the tuning fork by striking it on the sole of your rubber shoes and hold it on top of the graduated cylinder.<br>
			4. When no loud sound is produced increase the amount of water up to a level where loud sound is produced when the vibrating tuning fork is placed on top. Note this level of water.<br>
			5. Fill the HOT graduated cylinder with hot water (about 70oC) to the same level as that of the ROOM TEMP cylinder.<br>
			6. Fill the COLD graduated cylinder with COLD water (about 5OC) at the same level as that of the ROOM TEMP cylinder.<br>
			7. Determine the temperature of the water in each of the cylinders just before sounding the tuning fork.<br>
			8. Sound the tuning fork in each of the cylinders and note the sound produced by each cylinder. Record all your observations.<br>
			9. Do this for three trials focusing on the differences in the pitch of the sound each cylinder creates. Record all your observations.<br><br>

			Q27. Which cylinder gave the loudest sound?<br>
			Q28. Which cylinder gave the highest pitched sound?<br>
			Q29. If pitch is directly dependent on frequency, then, which cylinder gives the highest frequency sound?<br>
			Q30. Since wave speed is directly dependent on frequency, then, which cylinder gives the fastest sound?<br>
			Q31. How would you relate the temperature of the medium with the speed of sound?<br><br><br>
