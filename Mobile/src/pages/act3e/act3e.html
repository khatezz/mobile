		<ion-card-header>Activity 6<br>Reflecting and refracting sound</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objective:</b><br><br>

			At the end of the activity, you will be able to observe how longitudinal waves reflect and refract.<br><br>

			<b>Materials:</b><br><br>

			metal slinky (large coil)<br>
			metal slinky (small coil)<br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			Sound Reflection<br><br>

			1. Connect the fixed end to a wall or post. Make or create longitudinal waves by pushing and pulling the movable end part.<br>
			2. Observe the longitudinal waves as the waves hit the wall or post. Record your observations.<br>
			3. Note the positions of the compressions before they reach the post. Note also the locations or positions of the compressions after hitting the wall of the post.<br>
			4. Do this for 3 trials.<br>
			Q32. What happens to the compressions or rarefactions when they hit the wall or a fixed end?<br>
			Q33. Are the compressions found on the same location in the slinky before and after hitting the wall?<br>
			Q34. What happens to sound waves when they hit a fixed end or the wall?<br><br>

			Sound Refraction<br><br>

			1. Connect the fixed end of the metal slinky (small coil) to a wall or post. Then connect another slinky (large coil) to the other end of the small coil. Make or create longitudinal waves by pushing and pulling the movable end of the metal slinky (large coil).<br>
			2. Observe the longitudinal waves as the waves move from the large coil-metal slinky to the small coil metal slinky. Record your observations.<br>
			3. Observe the frequency, amplitude, and speed of the longitudinal waves as the waves move from the large coil metal slinky to the small coil metal slinky.<br>
			4. Do this for 3 trials.<br>
			Q35. What happens to the frequency of the longitudinal waves as the waves move from the large coil slinky to the small coil slinky?<br>
			Q36. What would be an observable change in sound when the frequency changes?<br>
			Q37. What happens to the amplitude of the longitudinal waves as the waves move from the large coil slinky to the small coil slinky?<br>
			Q38. What happens to sound when the amplitude of the sound changes?<br>
			Q39. What happens to the speed of the longitudinal waves as the waves move from the large coil slinky to the small coil slinky?<br><br><br>
