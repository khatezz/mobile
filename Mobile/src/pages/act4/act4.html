		<ion-card-content>
			
		<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

		At the end of the activity, you will be able to infer that:<br><br>
		1. white light is made up of many different colors of light; and<br>
		2. each of these colors of light bends differently when it strikes objects like a prism.<br><br>

		<b>Materials:</b><br><br>

		a sunny window<br>
		plastic container filled with water<br>
		2 sheets of white paper<br>
		a small mirror<br>
		penlight<br>
		prism<br>
		stack of books<br><br>

		<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

		Part A: ROY G. BIV on paper using a bowl of water<br><br>
		1. Place the bowl near the window. Make sure that there is plenty of sunlight in that part of the window.<br><br>
		2. Set the mirror partway into the water facing the light as shown in the figure on the right.<br><br>
		3. Hold the piece of paper up to intercept the reflected beam.<br><br>
		4. Adjust the position of the mirror until you see color bands on the piece of paper.<br><br>


		Q1. List and arrange the observed colors according to how they appear on the paper.<br><br>

		Part B: ROY G. BIV using a prism<br><br>
		1. Position a stack of books near the window where there is plenty of sunlight.<br><br>
		2. Place a white sheet of paper on top of the stack of books.<br><br>
		3. On top of this sheet place the prism. Make sure that sunlight from the window reaches the prism.<br><br>
		4. Position the prism until a rainbow or the colors of light appear on the white sheet of paper.<br><br>
		5. Use the table below to note the refractive indices of the colors of light in acrylic or crown glass<br><br>

		6. Record all your observations in the worksheet provided.<br><br>

		Q2. Describe the position of the different colors after passing through the prism<br><br>
		Q3. Explain the dispersion of white light. Why is the prism or water able to separate the colors of white light?<br><br>
		Q4. Compare your results in the first part with your results in the second part. Are there any differences? What might account for the differences?<br><br>
		Q5. What did you observe with the indices of refraction of the colors of light in the acrylic prism?<br><br>
		Q6. How would this indices of refraction account for the arrangement of colors of light?<br><br><br>
