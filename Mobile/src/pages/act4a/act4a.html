		<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

		At the end of the activity, you will be able to observe that bending depends on the refractive index of the color of light.<br>
		<br>

		<b>Materials:</b><br><br>

		2 sheets of white paper<br>
		a small mirror<br>
		flashlight<br>
		prism<br><br>

		<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

		1. Place or position two glass prisms on top of a white sheet of paper and near a white screen. It would be better if the white screen is positioned vertically.<br><br>
		2. Position a flashlight on the other side of the prism. Switch on the flashlight and let the light strike the mirror.<br><br>
		3. Make the necessary adjustment in the position of the prism or in the position of the flashlight until you observe a clear view of the different colors of light on the screen.<br><br>
		4. Mark the position of the colors of light on the white screen. Mark also the positions of the flashlight and the prism on the white sheet of paper.<br><br>
		5. Trace the light beam from the flashlight to the prism. Then trace the light ray from the prism to each of the colors of light on the white screen.<br><br>
		6. Draw line AO that bisects the prism located near the white screen vertically.<br><br>

		Q7. Did you observe the colors of light just as they appeared in the first activity?<br><br>
		Q8. How were these colors of light arranged on the white screen?<br><br>
		Q9. With respect to line AO, which among the colors of light on the white screen is most bent, red light or blue light?<br><br>
		Below is a table of wavelength and refractive indices of the color of light in a crown glass prism.<br><br>

		Q10. How would you relate the refractive index with the bending of the color of light?<br><br><br>
