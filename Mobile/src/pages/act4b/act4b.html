			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			At the end of the activity, you will be able to infer that:<br><br>
			1. energy of the colors of light increases as one goes towards the right side of the color spectrum; and<br><br>
			2. red light has the least energy and blue light has the most energy.<br><br>

			<b>Materials:</b><br><br>

			six (6) thermometers (special thermometers which are sensitive to small changes in temperature)<br>
			colored plastic (half sheets of Red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet)<br>
			stapler<br>
			scissors<br>
			Scotch tape<br>
			string (nylon)<br>
			intense light source (if it is not sunny)<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. First, hang these thermometers in a shaded area. Wait for 10 minutes, then quickly observe and record the temperature shown by each thermometer. This will serve as the initial temperature of the thermometers. Wrap each thermometer with a different colored plastic. You may use Scotch tape to secure the thermometer.<br><br>

			2. Connect strings at the end part of the thermometer.<br><br>

			3. Then hang the thermometers with their respective wraps directly under the sun or an intense light source.<br><br>

			4. Record the temperature readings in each thermometer every five minutes.<br><br>
