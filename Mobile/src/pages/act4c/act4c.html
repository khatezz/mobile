		<ion-card-header>Activity 4<br>The color spectrum wheel revisited</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			At the end of the activity, you will be able to infer that:<br><br>
			1. light is composed of colors of different frequencies and wavelength;<br><br>
			2. the frequencies of the colors of light are inversely proportional to the wavelength;<br><br>
			3. the product of the frequency and the wavelength of the colors of light is a constant; and<br><br>
			4. the arrangement of colors of light shows the hierarchy of the colorâ€™s corresponding energy.<br><br>


			<b>Materials:</b><br><br>

			Color Spectrum Wheel Pattern<br> 
			Cardboard or illustration board <br>
			white screen <br>
			button fastener <br>
			glue or paste<br><br>

			<b>Procedure</b><br><br>

			Part 1: Color Wheel<br><br>

			1. Cut the two art files that make up the wheel on the next pages.<br>
			2. Cut along the lines drawn on the top wheel. Cut the 2 sides as shown. The small window near the center of the wheel should be completely cut out and removed.<br>
			3. Punch a hole at the center of the two wheels. You may use a button fastener to secure the two wheels together one on top of the other, but they should be free to rotate relative to each other.<br>
			4. When you see a region of the color spectrum show up in the open window and the "W,F, E" that correspond to that region showing up under the flaps, then you know that you have done it right.<br><br>

			Part 2: Characteristics of Light<br><br>

			1. Try out your Color Spectrum Wheel by positioning the innermost of the flaps on
			COLOR SPECTRUM. This will simultaneously position the other flaps to
			WAVELENGTH, FREQUENCY, and ENERGY.<br>
			2. Turn the upper wheel and observe the combinations.<br>
			3. Fill in the table below with the corresponding combinations you have observed
			using your Spectrum Color Wheel.<br><br>

			4. You will need to convert the equivalents of frequencies to Hz, the equivalent wavelengths to meters, and Joule to eV.<br><br>

			Q16. Which color registered the highest frequency? shortest wavelength?<br>
			Q17. Which color registered the lowest frequency? longest wavelength?<br>
			Q18. What did you observe about the wavelengths and frequencies of the different colors of light?<br>
			Q19. What did you observe about the products of frequencies and wavelengths?<br>
			Q20. Does the frequencies of the colors of light increase from Red to Violet?<br>
			Q21. What did you observe about the corresponding energies from Red to Violet?<br>
			Q22. How is frequency relate to energy of colors of light?<br><br>
