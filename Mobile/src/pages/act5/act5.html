		<ion-card-header>Explaining hotness or coldness</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			This first activity deals with one of the major effects of heat transfer, which is temperature change. You will describe the hotness or coldness of an object in terms of its temperature. You will also compare the changes in the temperature of water to determine the relationship between the amount of heat transferred and the resulting temperature change.

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			3 identical containers<br>
			thermometer<br>
			hot water<br>
			tap water (room temperature)<br>
			cold water<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Half-fill the three containers with equal amount of cold water. Arrange them next to one another as shown in Figure 1 below.<br><br>

			2. Place your finger for a while into any of the containers.<br><br>

			Try to recall your lesson on Heat Transfer in Grade 7 and answer the following questions:<br><br>

			Q1. What actually transferred when you dipped your finger into the water? In what direction did it transfer?<br><br>
			Q2. Was the water ‘hot’ or ‘cold’? Explain.<br><br>
			Discuss your answers with the group. Try to estimate the temperature of the water in the containers.<br><br>
			3. Measure with a thermometer the temperature of the water in each container. Record your measurements in Table 1 below. (Note: The initial temperature of the water in each container should be the same as they come from the same source.)<br><br>

			Q3. How close is your estimated value to the measured temperature of the water?<br><br>
			4. Add the same amount of hot water to container 1, tap water to container 2 and the same cold water to container 3. Leave the containers for a while.<br><br>
			5. Dip your fingers again, this time into the three containers. Make sure that you do not dip the same finger into the containers.<br><br>
			Q4. Which container feels ‘hottest’? Which container feels ‘coolest’?<br><br>
			Q5. What do you think causes the difference in the hotness or coldness of the water inside the containers?<br><br>
			6. Measure and record the temperature of the water in all containers. Calculate the change in the temperature of water in each container.<br><br>
			Q6. In which container(s) is heat transfer taking place? What evidence best supports your answer? Within this container, which absorbs heat? Which gives off heat?<br><br>
			Q7. In which container was there the greatest amount of heat transferred? What is the basis of your answer?<br><br>

			Q8. How are the amount of heat transferred and the change in temperature of water related?<br><br><br>
