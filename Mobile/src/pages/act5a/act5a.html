			At the end of this activity, you should be able to explain the scattering of the dye in water at different temperatures.<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			3 transparent containers<br>
			1 thermometer<br>
			3 plastic droppers<br>
			hot water<br>
			tap water (room temperature)<br>
			cold water<br>
			dye (Food color)<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Fill the three containers separately with cold water, tap water, and hot water.<br><br>
			2. Measure the temperature of the water in each container. Record your measurements in Table 2 below.<br><br>

			3. With the dropper, place a drop of dye into the center of each container as shown in Figure 2. (Note: It is better if you place drops of dye into the three samples simultaneously.)<br><br>

			4. Carefully observe and compare the behavior of the dye in the three containers. Write down your observations in Table 2.<br><br>
			Q9. What similarities and differences did you observe when a drop of dye was added to each container?<br><br>
			Q10. In which container did the dye scatter the fastest? In which di it scatter the slowest?<br><br>
			Q11. How do you relate the temperature of the water to the rate of scattering of the dye?<br><br><br>
