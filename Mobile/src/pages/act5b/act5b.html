		<ion-card-header>What happens when ice melts?</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			After this activity, you should be able to answer this question:<br><br>
			What happens to the temperature of water while changing from ice to liquid water?<br><br>

			<b>Materials needed:</b><br><br>

			crushed ice<br>
			1 glass container<br>
			timer (stopwatch)<br>
			stirring rod<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Put some crushed ice and a little cold water into the container.<br><br>
			2. Stir the contents of the container for few seconds; then, measure the temperature of the contents.<br><br>

			Avoid letting the thermometer touch the bottom of the container to ensure that you are actually measuring the temperature of the water.<br><br>


			Record your temperature reading in Table 3 below.<br><br>

			3. Repeat step 2 every 2 minutes. Make sure that you stir and measure exactly the same way each time. Record each measurement in Table 3.<br><br>
			Q15. Why does the ice inside the container melt after sometime?<br><br>
			4. Continue measuring until the ice has totally melted and even after it has already melted completely (around 4-6 minutes more).<br><br>
			5. Construct a temperature against time graph. Draw a smooth line that passes through almost all the points.<br><br>
			Q16. Which is your dependent variable? Which is your independent variable? (Note that the independent quantity is plotted along the X-axis while the dependent quantity is plotted along the Y-axis.<br><br>
			Q17. Describe your graph.<br><br>
			Q18. Describe the temperature of the water while the ice melting.<br><br>
			Q19. Describe the temperature of the water after the ice has melted.<br><br>
