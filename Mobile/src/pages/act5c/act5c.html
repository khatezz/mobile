		<ion-card-header>What happens to the temperature of water as it boils?</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Materials:</b><br><br>

			beaker<br>
			stirrer<br>
			thermometer (can measure up to 100Â°C)<br>
			alcohol burner<br>
			water (hot water)<br>
			stand or tripod with wire gauze<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Fill the beaker with 100 mL hot water and place it above the alcohol burner using the tripod with wire gauze.<br><br>
			2. Measure and record the temperature of the water every 2 minutes until it boils. Once the water starts to boil, continue taking the temperature for 4-6 more minutes.<br><br>
			3. Plot the graph of temperature against time.<br><br>
			Q20. Describe and interpret your graph.<br><br>
			Q21. What similarities and differences have you noticed between your graphs in Activity 3.1 and Activity 3.2?<br><br>

			If you heat up the same sample from ice to water then from water to gas (vapor) and plot the graph of temperature vs time, it would look like the graph in Figure 5. The graph shows that the ice absorbs heat as evidenced by the temperature rise; the temperature remains the same when ice starts to melt and until all the ice has melted; then the temperature rises again until water boils. The temperature remains constant at boiling temperature when water starts turning to steam and until all the liquid water has become water vapor.<br><br>
