			<b>Task:</b><br><br>

			In this activity, your group is assigned to plan and conduct a simple investigation to determine the relationship between the mass of a material and the amount of heat that it can transfer. You need to gather and analyze data to come up with answers to the question given above. Apply what you learned in grade 7 about doing simple investigations.<br><br>

			1. Start with your groupâ€™s prediction below:<br><br>

			Prediction: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
			_____________________________________________________________<br><br>

			2. Below are some guides to help you with your task.<br><br>
			a. What are your variables?<br><br>
			Independent variable:<br>
			Dependent variable:<br><br>
			Controlled variable (constant):<br><br>
			b. What materials are you going to use for your simple investigation?<br>
			c. What quantities are you going to measure for your data?<br>
			d. How are you going to analyze and present your quantities (data) to describe the relationship among the variables?<br><br>
			3. Write your step-by-step procedure. Let your teacher check your procedure first before you proceed. Precautions should always be observed.<br><br>
			4. Present your data systematically.<br><br>

			If you were successful in your investigation, you would have realized that the amount of heat transferred depends not only on the temperature of the material. It also depends on the mass or amount of material. Objects with greater mass have more thermal energy and can transfer more heat.<br><br><br>
