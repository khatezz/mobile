		<ion-card-header>Comparing heat capacities</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to compare the heat capacities of the given liquid samples.<br><br>

			<b>Materials:</b><br><br>

			2 identical small containers (each with 100mL of liquid sample)<br>
			2 identical large containers (large enough to accommodate the small containers)<br>
			2 thermometers<br>
			hot water<br>
			liquid samples: water, cooking oil<br><br>
			Note: Store the liquid samples in the same room to ensure that both are at room temperature when you do the activity.<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Pour 100mL of water into one of the small containers and the same amount of cooking oil into the other container. Measure and record their initial temperature in Table 4 below.<br><br>

			2. Place the small container with oil in a larger container with hot water. Make sure that the hot water does not mix with the liquid sample.<br><br>

			3. Measure the time it takes for the oil to increase in temperature by 5 °C. Example, if the initial temperature of the liquid is 28C, take the time it takes for the temperature to reach 33C. Record your measured heating time in Table 4.<br><br>

			4. Do the same with the water sample. Make sure that the amount and
			temperature of the hot water is the same for both samples. Record also your
			measurement in Table 4.<br><br>
			Q22. Which liquid requires more time to increase in temperature by 5 degrees?<br><br>
			Q23. Which liquid requires more heat to increase in temperature by 5 degrees?<br><br>
			Q24. Which liquid has a greater heat capacity?<br><br><br>
