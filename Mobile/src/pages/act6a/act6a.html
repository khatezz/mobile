			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to determine the relationship between electric current and resistance.<br><br>


			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			1 ammeter<br> 
			2 dry cells<br>
			2 dry cell holders <br>
			4 connecting wires<br>
			1 switch <br>
			3 flashlight bulbs (voltage rating of 2.5V each)<br>
			3 bulb holders<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Construct a simple circuit using one bulb, 2 dry cells and an ammeter as shown in Figure 7. Record the electric current measurement in Table 2. Once the task is done, turn off the switch.<br><br>

			2. To increase the resistance, add another bulb in the circuit. Connect the ammeter and record the electric current measurement in Table 2. Once the task is done, turn off the switch.<br><br>

			3. To further increase the resistance, add another bulb in the circuit. Connect the ammeter and record the electric current measurement in Table 2. Once the task is done, turn off the switch.<br><br>

			Q10. Based on Table 2, what happens to the current in the circuit as the resistance increases (increasing of bulbs)?
			<br><br>
			4. Connect the ammeter at different points around the circuit shown in Figure 10. Make sure that the positive terminal of the ammeter is connected to the positive terminal of the dry cell while the negative terminal is connected to the negative terminal of the dry cell. Once the task is done, turn off the switch.<br><br>

			Q11. Compare the current at different points in the circuit.<br><br>
			Q12. What can you infer about the current through the circuit?<br><br><br><br>
