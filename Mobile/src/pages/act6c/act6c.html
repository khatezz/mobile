			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>

			1. describe the heating effect of current;<br>
			2. explain what a short circuit is; and<br>
			3. explain the reason behind some safety practices in the use of electricity.<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			4A For Activity<br>                        
			2 dry cells in a battery holder <br>                 
			2 connecting wires<br>                              
			1 fine strand of copper wire (20 cm long)<br>       
			2 small blocks of wood<br>
			4 thumbtacks<br>
			2 short candles<br>
			Timer<br>
			<br>
			For Activity 4B<br>
			2 connecting wires<br>
			2 dry cells in a battery holder<br>
			1 bulb in a bulb holder<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>


			<b>4A. What makes it hot?</b><br><br>

			1. Place two wooden blocks side by side. To keep them from being moved, place masking tape underneath each block to keep them steady on the table.<br><br>
			2. Place two thumbtacks on each wooden block near the space between them. Wrap the copper wire tightly around the thumbtacks as shown, leaving two free ends on the same wooden block. Press the thumbtacks fully until the head of the thumbtacks is just above the wood.<br><br>

			3. Place a candle on top of the wires as shown below.<br><br>

			4. Connect the two free ends of the copper wire to the battery using the connecting wires. Leave the circuit closed for 30 seconds and then disconnect the battery. Observe the candle. Write your observation and explanation.<br><br>

			5. Try adding another dry cell as shown in the circuit using another candle. Repeat steps 3 and 4 and write your observation.<br><br>

			<img src="img/99.png"><br><br>

			Q19. What happened to the candle for both setups?<br><br>
			Q20. When you increase the voltage by adding another dry cell, what happens to the amount of current in the circuit?<br><br>
			Q21. Compare the effect on the candle with two dry cells and with three dry cells in the circuit. What is produced in the wires that affected the candle? How does the effect on the candle relate to the amount of current in the wire?<br><br>


			<b>4B. Don’t keep it short!</b><br><br>

			1. Remove about 2 cm insulation from the ends of the connecting wires.<br><br>
			2. Construct a circuit using the bulb, 2 batteries, and connecting wires with exposed parts you made in step 1.<br><br>

			3. Make the exposed parts of the wire touch momentarily. Do not keep them in contact for so long.<br><br>
			Q22. What happened to the bulb?<br><br>
			4. Draw the setup and trace the path the current takes when the exposed parts of the wires touch each other.<br><br>
			Q23. Explain what happened to the bulb when the exposed wires momentarily touched.<br><br>
			Q24. When the exposed wires were momentarily touched the path of current was shortened (hence the term short circuit) compared to the original path which include the bulb. What was the effect on the resistance of the circuit when the path of current was shortened or when a short circuit occurred?<br><br>
			Q25. What was the effect on the current when a short circuit occurred?<br><br>
			Q26. Why do short circuits cause fire?<br><br>


			A short circuit happens when the exposed parts of the electrical wires touch one another. When the exposed wires were made to touch, a shortened path was provided for the current, hence the term short circuit. Since the path has been shortened, current will no longer take the path through the bulb, thereby decreasing the total resistance in the path of current. This will result in a large current in the shortened circuit. Short circuits are dangerous especially with the high line voltage in our houses (220V compare to 1.5V of dry cells) because the large current produced can generate a lot of heat that could start a fire.<br><br>

			The current that a wire of given diameter can safely carry is indicated by its current rating. When the current in the circuit exceeds the wire’s current rating, an overload of the circuit occurs. Overloading can also generate a lot of heat in the wire that can cause a fire outbreak.<br><br>

			In designing electrical installations, engineers estimate the current requirements of appliances and electrical devices the owner intends to use and make these as the basis for selecting the appropriate size of wire in wiring the house.<br><br>

			When there are too many appliances plugged into one outlet (also called octopus wiring) the loads are effectively connected in parallel and overloading may also occur. Figure 16 shows an example of octopus wiring.<br><br>


			Q27. What happens to the total resistance of the circuit when more and more appliances are connected to one outlet?<br><br>
			Q28. What happens to the total current?<br><br>
			Q29. Overloading a circuit can start a fire. Explain.<br><br>
