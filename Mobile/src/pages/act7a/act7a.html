			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>
			1. explain how faults generate earthquakes; and<br>
			2. explain why not all movement along faults produces earthquakes.<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			two small boxes (fruit juice boxes are ideal)<br>
			masking tape<br>
			rubber band<br>
			paper clip<br><br>


			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Attach the rubber band to the paper clip. Then attach the paper clip to one end of one box. (See Figure 5. The ruler is included for scale.)<br><br>

			2. Place the boxes side by side. Put a toy house on the box with the rubber band. Then tape (lightly?) the two boxes together as shown in Figure 6. Important: Do not stick the tape on the boxes too much. The tape is meant to come off.<br><br>

			3. With your left hand, hold the box without the rubber band in place. With your other hand, slowly pull on the rubber band in the direction shown in Figure 7.<br><br>
			Q3. What happens to the rubber band?<br><br>

			Q4. Keep on pulling on the rubber band. What happens to the box attached to the rubber band? Note: The tape is supposed to come off, so stick it on very lightly.<br><br>
			
			Q5. What happens to the “house”?<br><br>
			Q6. Which is the “fault” in this setup?<br><br><br><br>
