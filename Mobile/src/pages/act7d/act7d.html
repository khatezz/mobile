			flat basin or laundry tub (batya)<br>
			water<br>
			rectangular piece of plastic panel or plywood<br>

			2. At the other end of the container, put the plastic panel flat at the bottom of the container (Figure 16, left).<br><br>
			3. You will need some help: a person to watch the surface of the water, and another to watch the level of water by the rock. Things will happen quickly, so make sure your assistants are alert.<br><br>

			4. Hold the corners of the plastic panel with your thumbs and fingertips. Wait for the water to stop moving. Using only your fingertips, jerk the edge of the plastic board upward (Figure 16, right).<br><br>
