		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>

			1. explain what two weather factors tell weathermen that a certain location is at the eye of a tropical cyclone; and<br><br>
			2. put in simple words the statement “calm before the storm.”<br><br>

			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			weather data (air pressure and wind speed)<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Figure 1 consists of two illustrations. The top one shows a tropical cyclone as seen at an angle. White rain bands move around the center or “eye”. The bottom illustration shows a cross-section of a tropical cyclone. It is like slicing it in half and looking at it from the side.<br><br>

			Q7. Location A is within the eye of the tropical cyclone. B, C and D are locations that are more and more distant from the eye. The air pressure at the different locations are:<br><br>

			Compare the air pressures at A, B, C and D. What do you notice?<br><br>

			Q8. Location E is within the eye of the tropical cyclone. Location F is within the clouds surrounding the eye. The clouds at F make up the eyewall. The wind speed at the two locations are:<br><br>
