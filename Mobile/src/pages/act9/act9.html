		<ion-card-header>What happens when a comet or an asteroid hits Earth?</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<b>Objectives:</b><br><br>

			After performing this activity, you should be able to:<br><br>
			1. describe how impact craters are formed when a comet or asteroid hits Earth based on a simulation; and<br><br>
			2. present observations on simulating a comet or asteroid impact using drawings.<br><br>


			<b>Materials Needed:</b><br><br>

			1 rectangular container (aluminum tray or plastic)<br>
			1 pebble (1-4 cm in diameter)<br>
			colored flour/colored starch<br>
			pencil<br><br>

			<b>Procedure:</b><br><br>

			1. Fill the rectangular tray with colored flour about 3-4 centimeters deep.<br>
			2. Place the tray on top of a table (or armrest of a chair).<br>
			3. Throw a pebble to hit the flour in the tray. Do this about four times, hitting different parts of the flour in the tray.<br><br>

			4. In the space below, draw the shape of the “craters” made by the pebble on the colored flour as:<br><br>

			5. Compare the shape of the pebble’s “crater” with the shape of the impact crater photo shown below.<br><br>

			Q1. What do you notice about the shape of your pebble’s crater and the shape of the impact crater shown in the photo?<br><br>

			Q2. What do you think happened to the plants and animals living in the area where the comet or asteroid crashed?<br><br><br><br>
