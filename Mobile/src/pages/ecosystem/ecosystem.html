			<b>Overview</b><br>
			Food plays a central role in the survival of species. Food gives organisms energy that enables them to carry out the many activities they do each day; this includes predators chasing a prey or a prey escaping a predator, arboreal organisms climbing trees to gather fruits, or fish swimming in schools in search for food, to name a few. Organisms are able to obtain energy from the foods they eat through digestion.<br><br>

			Digestion of food is carried out by the organs and substances of the digestive system. During digestion, food is broken down to smaller parts -- a fraction of which is made up of nutrients. These nutrients are circulated to the different parts of the body through the bloodstream and assimilated by cells.<br><br>

			Almost all animals have a digestive system in which food enters the mouth, is moved through a long tube, and exits the anus as feces. The food is broken down into soluble molecules and is moved rhythmically by the smooth muscle in the walls of the digestive organs.<br><br>

			Different species of organisms have different ways of digesting their food. In humans, digestion starts in the mouth where food is chewed and broken down to smaller pieces for easier digestion. This is called mechanical digestion. Initial chemical digestion starts also in the mouth. This is carried out by enzymes -- molecules that speed up chemical reactions. Enzymes present in saliva such as amylase helps break down carbohydrates, which are large complex molecules, into simpler ones that can be used by the body.<br><br>

			After swallowing, the food -- now turned into a bolus -- enters the esophagus (gullet) and is moved down into the stomach where it mixes with gastric juices and acids. Other enzymes such as protease and lipase help break down proteins in the stomach and fats in the small intestine, respectively. Digestion ends in the small intestine where nutrients are absorbed in the villi and enter the circulatory system. Wastes that remain after digestion go to the large intestine where water is also reabsorbed. These wastes, including the water that was not reabsorbed, are temporarily stored in the rectum before they are excreted out of the body through the anus.<br><br>

			Digestion in other organisms works similarly. However, there are specialized structures found in some species that perform special digestive functions.<br><br>

			This module introduces you to the different organs that make up the digestive system of animals and how they interact with each other to digest food and nourish their bodies. Emphasis is given on the human digestive system and its processes.<br><br>

			In Activity 1, you should have inferred that the digestive system is made up of different organs that work together to break down food and nourish the body. Describe the illustrations on the board game. What do these illustrations represent? What do the spaces or boxes drawn on the board game represent?<br><br>

			Notice that the board game is just an analogy of the structures of the digestion system and the processes they carry out. Refer to Figure 1 to compare the illustrations on the board game with the actual structures or organs of the digestive system.<br><br>

			Are these structures also found in other organisms? Are these structures in the digestive system of humans the same as those found in other organisms? Do they serve the same or similar functions?<br><br>

			<img src="img/186.png"><br><br>

			The digestive systems of animals and the organs that make them up vary across species. Some structures like the rumen, crop, and gizzard are found only in some species. The rumen is common among ruminants that include the goats, cows, and carabaos. What do you think is the function of this structure? The crop and gizzard are found in birds and some species of invertebrates like the grasshoppers and earthworms. What functions do you think do these structures perform in digestion?<br><br>

			Almost all animals have a tubelike digestive system; one end of the tube serves as the mouth while the other end serves as the anus. This digestive system is called a Complete Digestive System. Food enters the mouth, passes through the long tube, and exits as feces through the anus.<br><br>

			The smooth muscles of the tubelike digestive organs move the food rhythmically through the system where it is broken down into absorbable forms. Outside of this tube are attached some accessory organs -- the liver, gall bladder, and pancreas -- which also help in the digestion of food. Figure 2 shows a comparison of the digestive systems of different representative species of animals.<br><br>

			Q4. In what ways are the different digestive systems of animals similar? In what ways are they different?<br><br>

			The more primitive animals like the Hydra have a ‘digestive system’ with only one opening (see Figure 3) which is also called an Incomplete Digestive System. These organisms eat and defecate with their mouth which also alternates as their anus!<br><br>

			At certain times of the day, you hear your stomach rumbling. This is the sound you hear as the gastric juices are churned in an empty stomach. This indicates that you are already hungry and it is time for you to eat. The stomach and some glands start to produce gastric juices to prepare your stomach for the food you will eat. These gastric juices provide an acidic environment in the stomach. How do these gastric juices affect digestion in the stomach? In Activity 3, you will be introduced to the effect of pH on the digestion of food in the stomach and the intestine.<br><br>

			Carbohydrates are broken down to simple sugars that are absorbed in the small intestines; they are circulated to the different parts of the body as they join the bloodstream. They are used up as sources of energy once they are assimilated by the cells; those that are circulated into the liver are stored.<br><br>

			Proteins are broken down to their component parts -- also called amino acids -- in the stomach. This process is aided by acids secreted by the cells that make up the walls of the stomach and enzymes that are present in the gastric juice. Like the simple sugars, amino acids are absorbed in the small intestine through the villi -- the fingerlike structures that line the walls of the small intestines -- and circulated to the different parts of the body. Those that are circulated into the liver are stored as glycogen.<br><br>

			In the case of fats and lipids, their digestion is completed in the small intestine where bile secreted from the liver disintegrates them into fatty acids and glycerol – particles that are circulated to the rest of the body and stored in fatty tissues.<br><br>

			<b>Summary</b><br><br>

			Digestion starts when food is taken into the mouth. This is called ingestion. As you chew, you are breaking the food into small pieces as a means of mechanical breakdown. The pieces mix with saliva before you swallow. Saliva is a watery liquid made by the salivary glands. It softens and wets the food in the mouth and also initially starts chemical digestion through the enzymes present in it. Then the food passes through the esophagus. Muscle contractions in the esophagus help move the food down to the stomach. This process is called peristalsis (see Figure 4).<br><br>


			Stomach juices are chemicals made by the body that help digest food. The stomach is made up of muscles that churn and help mix the food and break it into even smaller pieces.<br><br>

			The digestive glands in the stomach lining produce acids and enzymes that digest proteins. These digestive juices could, in fact, harm the stomach. However, a thick mucus layer helps keep this acidic chemical environment from destroying the tissues of the stomach.<br><br>

			Digested molecules of food are absorbed through the small intestine. The walls of the small intestine contain many folds that are lined up with tiny fingerlike protrusions called villi. These villi are in turn covered with even smaller protrusions called microvilli. These structures increase the surface area through which nutrients are absorbed. During absorption, these nutrients pass through the walls of the intestine and into the bloodstream where they get transported to the different parts of the body.<br><br>

			The undigested parts of food or those that were not absorbed by the body are eliminated as feces. This process is called elimination or defecation. Figure 5 shows how food is changed to soluble forms as it is moved from one part of the digestive system to another.<br><br>
