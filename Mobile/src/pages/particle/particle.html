		<ion-card-header>The Particle Nature Of Matter</ion-card-header> 
			<ion-card-content> 
			<b>Overview</b><br>
			In Grade 7, you recognized that there is a wide variety of materials and these materials combine in many ways and through different processes. With this diversity of materials, you learned that chemists came up with several ways of classifying them—heterogeneous and homogeneous mixtures, elements and compounds, metals and non-metals, and acids and bases. By engaging in simple scientific investigations, you were able to recognize some properties of solutions, which are classified as homogeneous mixtures. You also studied the properties of common elements, compounds, metals and non-metals, as well as solutions of acids and bases.<br><br>

			The approach in this module is for you to observe, experience and represent through drawings, illustrations, or cartoons the different phenomena that will help you gradually understand what the particle nature of matter is all about. In Activity 1, you will use what you have learned in previous grade levels to differentiate matter from those which are not matter. In the second and third activities, you will look at situations that support the idea that matter is made up of tiny particles, which you cannot observe with your unaided eyes. This fundamental idea will enable you to learn that the properties of matter are a result of the arrangement of particles it is made of. In Activities 4 to 6, you will use and apply the particle model of matter to explain the following changes in matter: liquid to gas, gas to liquid, solid to liquid, and liquid to solid. At the end of Module 1, you will be able to answer the following key questions.<br><br>

			Based on your observations, you have just described some characteristics of matter. As you were observing each sample of matter in Activity 1, you were focusing on particular characteristics. These characteristics that describe a sample of matter are called properties. Matter can have different properties. You measured the mass of each sample of matter using a balance or a weighing scale. The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter the object has. You observed that the mass of each sample of matter in Activity 1 is different from the mass of the other samples. You also found out that each sample of matter occupies space. The measure of the space occupied by an object is called volume. All matter have mass and volume. There are other properties of matter such as hardness, texture, color, flexibility, malleability, and electrical conductivity which vary from one sample to another.<br><br>

			Recall that in Grade 7, you studied other properties of matter. You performed activities to find out some common properties of solutions. You investigated how fast sugar and salt dissolve in water. You compared the boiling point of a substance (distilled water) with that of a mixture (sea water).<br><br>

			Now that you can correctly describe matter based on the properties you have observed, it is important that you know what matter is made of. What makes up matter? If you hammer the stone you used in Activity 1 into much smaller pieces, what would you get? If you turn the sugar into very fine powder, what would result? Ice, liquid water, and steam are all the same substance, which is water, yet you can observe that they look different from each other? How can this be explained? These questions can be answered in the next activity.<br><br>

			<button ion-button block color="primary" (click)="nextPage1()" > Activity 2 </button><br><br>


			Studying about what matter is made of involves dealing with very small “particles” beyond what your eyes can see. In fact, the ancient Greek philosophers proposed ideas about what matter was made of. Almost 2,500 years ago, Leucippus and his disciple, Democritus believed that nature consisted of two things, “atoms and the void that surrounds them” (Knieram, 1995-2013). They believed that “atoms are physically, but not geometrically, indivisible.” For Democritus, atoms are indestructible and completely full, so there is no empty space. Both Leucippus and Democritus had the idea that there are many different kinds of atoms and each of them had specific shape and size and that all atoms move randomly around in space. However they did not give an explanation for the motion of atoms. (Knieram, 1995-2013).<br><br>

			Democritus believed that any piece of matter can be divided and subdivided into very small particles but that this process ended at some point when a piece is reached that could not be further divided. He called this particle, atomos, a Greek word which means indivisible particle. Democritus’ ideas about the atom were later challenged by other Greek philosophers, most strongly by Aristotle.<br><br>

			The idea of the atom was not further explored until a little over two centuries ago when John Dalton presented concrete evidence that all matter is made of very small particles called atoms. An atom is the smallest particle of an element that has all the properties of the element. Today, we know that although atoms are very small, they are not indivisible as Democritus thought, rather they consist of still smaller particles, Democritus was right in one aspect of his belief, that is, atoms are the smallest particles of which substances are made. In Grade 7, you learned about elements. Atoms of most elements have the ability to combine with other atoms. Different elements have different properties because the combining atoms are different and the way the atoms are joined together are different. In Module 2 of this quarter, you will learn about how the model of the atom evolved until the present time. You will also learn that an atom is made of even smaller parts.<br><br>

			A molecule is a particle consisting of two or more atoms combined together in a specific arrangement. It is an electrically neutral particle. It is the smallest particle of an element or compound that can exist independently. For example, a molecule of water consists of an oxygen atom combined with two hydrogen atoms. Atoms of the same element can also combine to form a molecule. For example, oxygen in the air consist of oxygen molecules which are made up of two oxygen atoms.<br><br>

			Atoms are too small to observe. These particles cannot be seen under the high-powered light microscopes used in school laboratories. The size of an atom is measured in angstroms. One angstrom is a unit of length equal to one ten millionth of a millimetre.<br><br>

			The best light microscope can magnify an image only about 1,500 times. Electron microscopes create a highly magnified image of up to 1 million times. The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) allows scientists to view and scan the surface of very small particles like atoms. It can magnify an image 10 million times. The STM creates a profile of the surface of an atom and then a computer-generated model or contour map is produced. So, only a model of the surface of an atom is generated by a computer when a scanning tunnelling microscope is used. The picture of atoms generated is unlike the picture we take with our cameras.<br><br>

			In Activity 2, when you mixed sugar and water and tasted the resulting solution, it tasted sweet because sugar is still present, though you cannot see the sugar anymore. The volume of the mixture is less than the sum of the volumes of the unmixed sugar and water. Why is this so? The water is made of tiny particles, molecules, with spaces between them. Sugar is also made up of molecules bigger than the molecules of water. The water molecules could fit in the spaces between the sugar molecules or vise versa.<br>
			<br>


			A good analogy to consider related to matter being composed of tiny particles is the pointillist style of painting. The images in a pointillist painting appear continuous but if one looks closely, the images are actually made of small dots. Pointillism is a method of painting using dots to come up with various effects. The dots are placed singly, in rows, or randomly. These dots can also be in groups or they can be overlapping. They can be either uniform or varied in size in the same painting. Matter is similarly assembled, with atoms of different elements combining in various ways to give a tremendous variety of substances.<br><br>

			<img src="img/156.png"><br><br>

			In Figure 1(a), the image of Dolores F. Hernandez, founding Director of the Science Education Center, now University of the Philippines National Institute for Science and Mathematics Education Development was done through pointillist painting. The image appears continuous. In Figure 1(b), a portion of the painting (boxed in Figure 1a) is blown up to show that the continuous image actually consists of dots. The lightness and darkness of the pigments give volume to the image in order to show smoothness. Similarly, matter, which appears to be continuous like the image in Figure 1(a) is made up of very small particles that cannot be seen with the unaided eye.<br><br>

			In the next activity, you will observe a situation to infer that particles of matter are moving and there are spaces between them.<br><br>

			<button ion-button block color="primary" (click)="nextPage2()" > Activity 3 </button><br><br>

			<b>Particle Models of the Three States of Matter</b><br><br>

			From Activity 3, you observed that you could slightly push the plunger of the syringe with air in it. You felt the springiness of the air inside the syringe which gives a hint about the distance between the particles of air. In other words, air, being a gas, can be compressed because there are large spaces between the particles so the particles can be made to come closer to each other. However, you were not able to push the plunger of the syringe with water in it. You felt the resistance of the water to being compressed. The plunger could not be pushed because water is not as compressible as air. The particles of liquid water are closer to each other and it is difficult to push them even closer to each other.<br><br>

			From the idea that matter is made up of particles and the situations that you observed, your drawings show how you “see” matter beyond what you can observe with your unaided eyes. You were creating your own mental picture and constructing models, which are drawings or diagrams that are representations of what is happening at a level beyond what your eyes can see. This is what science educators call the sub-microscopic model of representing an idea or concept, which you cannot observe with your senses or even aided by a simple microscope. From your discussions, you may have also thought of ways to make your models more consistent with the evidence you observed.<br><br>

			At this stage, it is possible that the mental models you have drawn do not perfectly match those that you see in books. Keep in mind that the models are not like the pictures taken by a camera. They are only representations of reality.<br><br>


			The particle model of matter shows that in gases, the particles move at random directions very quickly and travel in straight-line paths. In the process, they collide with one another and with the walls of the container. They change direction only when they rebound from the collisions. The distance between particles is large compared to the size of the particles. The attraction between particles is negligible because of the large distance between them. This explains why a gas spreads. Its particles fill all the available space in the container.<br><br>

			<img src="img/157.png"><br><br>

			Gases take the shape of the container because the particles are able to move freely to all parts of the container. They move freely because they are far apart and there is negligible attraction between them. This model also explains the compressibility of gases. The distances between particles are large and so there is room for the particles to move closer to each other.<br><br>

			In liquids, the particles are closer to one another, nudging one another as they move. Since the particles are closer to one another, the attraction between particles is stronger than those in gases. The particles move and change positions but not as freely as those in a gas.<br><br>

			As you observed in the activity liquids can flow out of a container and can be poured into another while maintaining their volume. This happens because there are attractions among the particles of liquid which hold them together although not in fixed positions. These attractions also make it possible for liquids to have a definite volume. This is one major difference between liquids and gases, the particles are attracted to one another more strongly than the particles of gases are.<br><br>

			<img src="img/158.png"><br><br>

			<img src="img/159.png"><br><br>

			There are other properties that you will learn in Grades 9 to 12 that will be useful for distinguishing among the states of matter. In general, the three states of matter differ because of the arrangement and motion of the particles in each state.<br><br>

			So far, based on Activities 1 to 3 and your teacher’s explanation, you learned that matter is anything that has mass and volume and you now have a better “picture” or view of how the particles are arranged in the three states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas.<br><br>

			? Matter is made up of tiny particles.<br>
			? Particles of matter are moving all the time.<br>
			? These particles have spaces between them.<br>
			? The particles of matter attract each other.<br><br>

			These ideas are some of the features of what scientists call the particle model of matter.<br><br>
			In Activity 4, you will explain the changes taking place when liquid water is left in an open and in a closed container using the particle model of matter.<br><br>

			<button ion-button block color="primary" (click)="nextPage3()" > Activity 4 </button><br><br>

			<b>Changes between a Liquid and a Gas</b><br><br>

			In Activity 4, you observed that the volume of water from an open container decreased after leaving it overnight. In fact, nothing of the 1/2 tablespoon of water was left on the watch glass. How do we explain this? Based on the particle model of matter, particles are always in motion. Note that the particles mentioned in this case are the molecules of water. These molecules have kinetic energies that differ from each other. Some particles are moving faster than others and therefore have higher kinetic energy and some are moving slower. So, even at room temperature, some molecules of water have enough kinetic energy to overcome the attraction of neighboring molecules and escape from the surface of the liquid and eventually move into the air. To break away from the surface of the liquid, the molecules must have at least some minimum kinetic energy. The process by which the molecules on the surface of a liquid break away and change into gas is called evaporation. Usually, it is described as the process where a liquid is changed into a gas.<br><br>

			As evaporation takes place, the water molecules which did not escape and were left in the liquid have a lower average kinetic energy than the molecules that escaped. The effect of this is the decrease in the temperature of the liquid water. Evaporation is a cooling process.<br><br>

			You can feel this cooling effect yourself when you apply acetone on your nails or rubbing alcohol on your arms. Acetone and rubbing alcohol are volatile liquids. They readily evaporate. As they evaporate, the molecules get heat energy from your body leaving you with a cool sensation.<br><br>

			It is important to remember that the evaporation of a liquid in a closed container is different from evaporation from an open container. In a closed container, no particles can escape into the air outside the cover of the container. In Activity 4, you may have observed that droplets of water formed under the watch glass which covered the second watch glass with water. So, evaporation still happens in a covered container. Some of the molecules of water on the surface of the liquid escape and go into the gaseous state. These molecules may then collide with the inner surface of the cover and as more and more of these molecules do so, some may stay on the cover, accumulate and form droplets. This process where a gas is changed into a liquid is called condensation. It is the reverse of evaporation.<br><br>


			In a closed container, the molecules of water continue to evaporate and condense, but there is no net change in the number of molecules in the liquid or in the gas phase. Molecules of water that previously evaporated are condensing, but other water molecules are evaporating.<br><br>

			There are many other examples of condensation that you may have observed. Condensation is responsible for ground-level fog that we see on some cold days or along the highway leading to Baguio, for your eye glasses fogging up when you go from an air conditioned room or vehicle to the outdoors on a hot day, and for the water that collects on the outside of your glass of cold drink.<br><br>

			In the next activity, you will represent your ideas through a written description, a cartoon, or simply an illustration and explain the changes taking place when water is heated or cooled using the particle model of matter.<br><br>

			<button ion-button block color="primary" (click)="nextPage4()" > Activity 5 </button><br><br>

 
			In Part A, Activity 5, you observed that after boiling water for some time, the amount of water inside the beaker decreased. As the water is heated and the temperature of the water rises, the molecules gain more kinetic energy and they move faster. More molecules therefore have the energy to overcome the forces of attraction of the adjacent molecules. These molecules escape to the gaseous phase. This is evaporation.<br><br>

			This evaporation and formation of gas can happen even below the surface of the liquid. When this happens bubbles are formed, rise to the surface and escape into the air. This is the bubbling phenomenon that you see when water boils.<br><br>

			In Part B, Activity 5 of this module, you observed that as the water began to cool, droplets formed under the watch glass that covered the beaker containing hot water. Where did these droplets come from? The molecules that escape from the liquid and go into the gaseous phase is called vapor and in this case, water vapor. The water vapor rises and some molecules touch the glass. The glass is cooler than the boiling water so some of the heat energy of the vapor molecules are transferred to the glass, in effect, cooling the water vapor. When a gas is cooled, the motion of the particles slows down. If the particles lose enough energy, their attraction for each other can overcome their motion and cause them to associate with one another to become a liquid. This is the liquid observed under the watch glass in the above activity. This process is called condensation.<br><br>

			Recall two aspects of the particle model of matter: particles are moving all the time and there are forces that act between the particles. These principles can explain at the sub-microscopic level what you observed in Part B, Activity 5. Not all of the water changed from liquid to water vapor. There was still liquid water left in the beaker. Some of the molecules do not have the energy to overcome the forces of attraction of the neighboring molecules. In addition, some of the molecules of water that escaped to the vapor phase, hit the molecules on the surface of the liquid and if they do not have sufficient energy, the attraction of molecules on the surface cause them to stay and join the liquid phase.<br><br>

			In Activity 6, you will draw a model and explain the changes taking place when ice is changed to liquid water using the particle model of matter.<br><br>

			<button ion-button block color="primary" (click)="nextPage5()" > Activity 6 </button><br><br>


			<b>Changes between a Solid and a Gas</b><br><br>

			In Activity 6, you observed that after about 15 to 20 minutes, the ice (solid water) on the watch glass or saucer turned into liquid water. The ice cube, which was taken from the freezer is at a lower temperature than the surrounding room temperature. Some of the heat energy of the surroundings is transferred to the water molecules in the ice. This increases the kinetic energy of the molecules and as the heat transfer continues, the particles gain more and more kinetic energy. The molecules vibrate faster and faster and at some point have enough energy to overcome the forces that hold them in their fixed places in the solid. Since the molecules vibrate so fast, they break away from their fixed positions. The arrangement of the water molecules in ice gradually becomes disorganized and the solid where the molecules are in fixed positions turns to liquid where the molecules are more free to move. This transformation process in which a solid is changed to a liquid is called melting.<br><br>

			On the other hand, when you put liquid water inside a freezer, the cooling system of the refrigerator removes heat energy from the water molecules as a result of which they have less kinetic energy and move more slowly. As more and more heat is removed and as the molecules move more slowly, the forces of attraction between the molecules cause the molecules to be aligned. As this removal of heat continues, the molecules lose so much energy that they are not able to move from place to place but only able to vibrate in place. In time, the liquid water becomes solid water, which is ice. Freezing is the process in which a liquid is changed to a solid.<br><br>

			Note that liquid water that freezes is still water. Similarly, ice that melts is still water. This is why after melting an ice cube, you can freeze the liquid water back to ice. In other words, the same molecules of water are involved when these changes occur.<br><br>

			In Activities 1 to 6, you have learned the four basic aspects of the particle model of matter. These are: (1) matter is made up of very small particles; (2) matter is made up of particles that are constantly moving; (3) there is empty space between the particles; and (4) there are forces that act between the particles. Using this model, you were able to infer that the arrangement and motion of the particles of matter, as well as the attraction between them change when they change from one state to another. However, the same particles of matter are involved when these changes happen. The particle model of matter can explain the following phase changes: evaporation, boiling, condensation, melting, and freezing.<br><br>
