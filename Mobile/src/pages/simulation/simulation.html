     <p>Food plays a central role in the survival of species. Food gives organisms energy that enables them to carry out the many activities they do each day; this includes predators chasing a prey or a prey escaping a predator, arboreal organisms climbing trees to gather fruits, or fish swimming in schools in search for food, to name a few. Organisms are able to obtain energy from the foods they eat through digestion.
