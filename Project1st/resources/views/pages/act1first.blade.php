			<b style="font-size: 20px;">Overview</b><br>
						
			<p>If you recall, it was mentioned in Grade 7 that the Philippines is located along the Ring of Fire. How does this affect us? People who live along the Ring of Fire have to put up with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In this module, we will focus on earthquakes.
			<br><br>
			An earthquake is one of the most frightening things that anyone can ever experience. You grow up believing that the Earth is rock solid and steady. But then the ground suddenly shakes and you do not know what to believe anymore.<br><br>

			Strong earthquakes have caused countless deaths all over the world, even before people have started recording these events. No wonder scientists have been working very hard to find a way to predict when an earthquake occurs.<br><br>

			No one can stop quakes from happening. But there are things that people can do to avoid or reduce loss of life and damage to property. The first step is to have a clear understanding of the occurrence of earthquakes.<br><br>

			

			<b>What is a Fault?</b><br><br>

			On July 16, 1990, a strong earthquake hit Luzon. Have you heard about it? Maybe not, because it happened before you were born. But if your parents are from Luzon, they surely know about the earthquake. It is possible that they were even affected by it.<br><br>

			During that earthquake, many people lost their lives and many more were injured. A lot of buildings and other structures were either damaged or destroyed. The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.8 and its epicenter was located in Nueva Ecija. According to scientists, the earthquake was caused by movement along the Philippine Fault.<br><br>

			Fault, epicenter, magnitude. Do you know what these terms mean? You will learn about them in this module. Let us start with faults.<br><br>

			Earthquakes are associated with faults. When a fault suddenly moves, an earthquake occurs. Do you know what a fault is? Do the following activity to find out.<br><br>

			
			Now, study Figure 4. Do you see anything unusual?<br><br>

			

			If you look at the picture carefully, you can guess that the road was originally in one piece. But the road is no longer continuous. There is a cut across the road and now there are two sections. One section has moved with respect to the other.<br><br>
			Compare what you see in the picture and what you saw in the activity. Is there something in the picture that looks like what was formed in the activity? Do you see anything similar?<br><br>

			Based on the activity and the picture, you can probably guess what a fault is by now. A fault is a break in the Earth’s crust, and along the break, significant movement has taken place.<br><br>

			<b>How do Faults Produce Quakes?</b><br><br>

			In the following activity, you will learn how earthquakes are related to faults.<br><br>


			

			Imagine the boxes as the ground, and the boundary between them as a fault. Energy from inside the Earth makes the ground move. You simulate this by pulling on the rubber band. There is no movement right away because of friction. (What represents friction in the activity?)<br><br>

			Once friction is overcome, the ground suddenly moves and an earthquake occurs. Some scientists describe this process as stick and slip. At first, the rocks are stuck together due to friction. Later, the rocks suddenly slip, generating an earthquake. Every time a fault slips, the Earth quakes.<br><br>

			In the activity, there was a sudden jerk, but no shaking. The boxes did not shake as in a real earthquake. Let us see what the next model does (shows?).<br><br>

			
			The activity you just performed simulates how rocks bend along a fault. Think of the rulers as if they were part of the ground. Figure 11 can help you visualize this.<br><br>
