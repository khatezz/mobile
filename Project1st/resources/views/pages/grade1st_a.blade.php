					<b style="font-size: 20px;" >UNIT 1: Force, Motion, and Energy</b><br>
								
					<p style="margin-right: 15px;">
						In Grade 7, students learned about the various forms of energy, namely
						motion energy, light, sound, heat, and electrical energy. They learned about the
						different energy forms in terms of their sources, their nature or characteristics, and
						the ways by which they can be transferred from one object or place to another. In
						Grade 8, students deepen their understanding of energy by describing how energy
						transfer affects, and is affected by, matter. They explore some changes when there
						is energy transfer such as changes in temperature, changes in the current in a
						circuit, or changes in the speed of sound travelling through a medium. They relate
						these changes to the energy of the particles that make up matter.
						This unit has six modules. The first two modules deal with the transfer of
						energy by applying force to large objects; Modules 3 and 4 discuss changes in
						energy of the particles of matter which accompany energy transfer; and Modules 5
						and 6 describe the interaction between waves and matter. Most of the lessons found
						in each module take off from the lessons covered in Grade 7.
						The table below shows the general and specific topics covered in Grade 8:
