                    <p>If you recall, it was mentioned in Grade 7 that the Philippines is located along the Ring of Fire. How does this affect us? People who live along the Ring of Fire have to put up with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In this module, we will focus on earthquakes.
                    <br><br>
                    An earthquake is one of the most frightening things that anyone can ever experience. You grow up believing that the Earth is rock solid and steady. But then the ground suddenly shakes and you do not know what to believe anymore.<br><br>

                    Strong earthquakes have caused countless deaths all over the world, even before people have started recording these events. No wonder scientists have been working very hard to find a way to predict when an earthquake occurs.<br><br>

                    No one can stop quakes from happening. But there are things that people can do to avoid or reduce loss of life and damage to property. The first step is to have a clear understanding of the occurrence of earthquakes.<br><br>
